# Implementation Plans

Detailed implementation plans created before development begins. Each plan documents the technical approach, dependencies, and step-by-step implementation strategy for a road item.

## Format

Plan files are named with the date and a descriptive slug:

```
YYYY-MM-DD-descriptive-name.md
```

## Plan Structure

Each plan includes:
- **Objective**: What the plan aims to achieve
- **Context**: Background and motivation
- **Technical Approach**: Detailed implementation strategy
- **Dependencies**: Required road items, ADRs, and external systems
- **Steps**: Ordered implementation steps
- **Risks**: Identified risks and mitigations
- **Acceptance Criteria**: How to verify completion

## Active Plans

Plans will be listed here as they are created.
