# CAP-009: DDD Domain Modeling API

## Description

The system provides a full CRUD REST API for Domain-Driven Design modeling. Users create domain model workspaces, then populate them with bounded contexts, aggregates, value objects, domain events, and glossary terms. The API returns nested representations of the complete domain model with all artifacts, enabling visualization in the DDD context map UI and integration with governance validation.

## Key Features

- Domain model workspace CRUD (create, list, get with nested artifacts, delete with cascade)
- Bounded context management (create, update, delete) with relationship tracking
- Aggregate registration with root entity, invariants, commands, and published events
- Value object registration with properties, validation rules, and immutability flag
- Domain event registration with payload schema, consumer contexts, and side effects
- Glossary term management for ubiquitous language tracking
- Nested retrieval: single GET returns model + all contexts, aggregates, events, value objects, glossary

## Personas

- **PER-001** (Engineering Team Lead) -- Views domain models in the context map UI, reviews glossary for ubiquitous language consistency
- **PER-002** (Platform Engineer) -- Creates and manages domain models via API, integrates with governance pipeline
- **PER-004** (Documentation Author) -- Populates domain model artifacts to formalize DDD documentation
