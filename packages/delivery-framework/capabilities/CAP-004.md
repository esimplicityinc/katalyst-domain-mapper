# CAP-004: Repository Scanning

## Description

The system provides a Docker-containerized scanner that auto-detects tech stacks, dispatches 5-6 specialist AI agents in parallel, and synthesizes findings into a unified FOE report. Agents analyze CI/CD pipelines, test suites, architecture patterns, domain modeling, documentation, and governance artifacts.

## Key Features

- Docker multi-stage build with pre-baked indices
- Auto-detection of monorepo structure and tech stack
- 6 specialist agents (CI, Tests, Architecture, Domain, Docs, Governance)
- Parallel agent dispatch for speed
- Batch-mode operation (no interactive prompts, JSON to stdout)
- Cognitive triangle diagnosis with minimum thresholds

## Personas

- **PER-001** (Engineering Team Lead) -- Initiates scans and reviews results
- **PER-002** (Platform Engineer) -- Maintains the scanner container and agents
- **PER-003** (AI Agent) -- Executes as specialist agents within the scanner
