# CAP-006: Confluence Integration

## Description

The system provides bidirectional integration with Atlassian Confluence. Inbound: pull wiki pages, ADRs, runbooks, and design documentation to enrich the Understanding dimension during scanning. Outbound: publish governance reports, roadmaps, DDD context maps, and capability dashboards to Confluence spaces so teams have governance visibility in their existing documentation platform.

## Key Features

- OAuth 2.0 and API token authentication with Confluence Cloud and Data Center
- Import adapter: pull wiki pages, ADRs, runbooks, and design documentation
- Export adapter: publish governance dashboards, roadmaps, and DDD artifacts to Confluence spaces
- Bidirectional sync engine with conflict resolution and page versioning
- Scanner enhancement: Understanding dimension scoring from Confluence content (freshness, coverage, quality)
- CLI commands: `confluence:sync`, `confluence:import` for on-demand and CI integration
- Configurable space mapping via `confluence-config.json`

## Personas

- **PER-001** (Engineering Team Lead) -- Views Confluence-enriched Understanding scores and published governance reports
- **PER-002** (Platform Engineer) -- Configures Confluence connection, manages space mappings, maintains sync
- **PER-003** (AI Agent) -- Consumes Confluence content during scanning for Understanding dimension assessment
