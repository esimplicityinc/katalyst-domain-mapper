# CAP-003: Field Guide Indexing

## Description

The system parses structured markdown files containing FOE methods (65 total: 17 FOE + 48 external frameworks) and observations (39 total), extracts 625+ keywords, and builds searchable JSON indices. These indices are baked into the scanner Docker container and consumed by the web UI for method linking.

## Key Features

- Method parsing with frontmatter validation (maturity levels, framework tags)
- Observation parsing with evidence extraction
- Keyword index generation (625+ keywords)
- Support for 7 external frameworks (DORA, DDD, BDD, Team Topologies, TDD, Continuous Delivery, Double Diamond)
- CLI commands: `build`, `validate`, `stats`

## Personas

- **PER-002** (Platform Engineer) -- Maintains parsers and build pipeline
- **PER-004** (Documentation Author) -- Authors method and observation files
- **PER-005** (Framework Adopter) -- Uses indices for their own field guide content
