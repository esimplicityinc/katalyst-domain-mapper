# CAP-002: Governance Validation

## Description

The system validates all governance artifacts against Zod schemas, checks referential integrity across cross-references (persona-to-capability, story-to-persona, road-to-ADR), verifies state machine transitions for ROAD items, and reports coverage gaps. Replaces hand-written JS validation scripts with type-safe, schema-driven tooling.

## Key Features

- Zod schema validation for 7 governance + 4 DDD artifact types
- Referential integrity checking across all cross-references
- 8-state governance machine transition validation
- Capability coverage and persona coverage reports
- CLI commands for CI/CD integration
- Governance index JSON generation with reverse indices

## Personas

- **PER-002** (Platform Engineer) -- Builds the validation pipeline
- **PER-003** (AI Agent) -- Runs validation before committing artifacts
- **PER-004** (Documentation Author) -- Uses validation to catch frontmatter errors
- **PER-005** (Framework Adopter) -- Integrates validation into their CI pipeline
