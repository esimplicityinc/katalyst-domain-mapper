# CAP-005: Jira Integration

## Description

The system provides bidirectional integration with Atlassian Jira. Inbound: pull issues, sprints, velocity, cycle time, and workflow data to enrich the Feedback dimension during scanning. Outbound: push ROAD items, capabilities, and user stories as Jira issues so teams can manage governance artifacts in their existing project management workflow.

## Key Features

- OAuth 2.0 and API token authentication with Jira Cloud and Data Center
- Import adapter: pull issues, sprints, velocity, cycle time, and WIP metrics
- Export adapter: push ROAD items and user stories as Jira issues with custom field mapping
- Bidirectional sync engine with conflict resolution (last-write-wins or manual merge)
- Scanner enhancement: Feedback dimension scoring from Jira delivery metrics
- **External roadmap source**: import Jira epics/boards as ROAD-XXX governance artifacts, replacing local ROADMAP.mdx
- CLI commands: `jira:sync`, `jira:import`, `roadmap:import --source jira` for on-demand and CI integration
- Configurable project mapping via `jira-config.json` and field mapping via `roadmap-source.json`

## Personas

- **PER-001** (Engineering Team Lead) -- Views Jira-enriched Feedback scores and synced governance items
- **PER-002** (Platform Engineer) -- Configures Jira connection, manages field mappings, maintains sync
- **PER-003** (AI Agent) -- Consumes Jira metrics during scanning for Feedback dimension assessment
