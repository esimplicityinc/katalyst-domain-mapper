# CAP-016: FOE Project Management

## Description

The system provides a multi-project tracking and management interface for FOE assessments. Users can browse all scanned projects in a grid view, search and sort by various criteria, and drill into individual projects via a tabbed detail view. This capability serves as the primary entry point for FOE assessment workflows, accessible from the Strategy lifecycle stage.

Each project card surfaces key metadata — project name, last scan date, overall score, and maturity level badge — enabling quick triage across a portfolio of repositories. Selecting a project persists the selection in localStorage so the user's context survives page refreshes and browser restarts.

The detail view provides six sub-navigation tabs (Overview, Dimensions, Triangle, Strengths, Gaps, Chat) that organize the full assessment output into digestible sections. This replaces the previous single-page report view with a structured, navigable experience.

## Key Features

- **Project List View**: Grid of all scanned FOE projects displaying name, last scan date, overall score, and maturity level badges (Hypothesized, Emerging, Practicing, Optimized)
- **Persistent Project Selection**: localStorage-based state that survives page refresh and browser restart, with graceful fallback when a persisted project no longer exists
- **Sub-Navigation**: 6 tabs per project (Overview, Dimensions, Triangle, Strengths, Gaps, Chat) providing structured access to assessment data
- **Project Search & Sort**: Filter projects by name, sort by date, score, or name in ascending/descending order
- **Empty State UX**: Clear call-to-action when no projects exist, guiding users to run their first scan
- **Strategy Integration**: FOE project management is accessible from the Strategy lifecycle stage in the main navigation

## Architecture

```
React Components
    ├── FOEProjectListPage       — Grid view with search/sort controls
    │   └── ProjectCard          — Individual project summary card
    ├── FOEProjectDetailPage     — Tabbed detail view for selected project
    │   ├── ProjectHeader        — Project name, score, maturity badge
    │   └── SubNavTabs           — 6-tab navigation (Overview, Dimensions, Triangle, Strengths, Gaps, Chat)
    ↓
ReportRepository API (Port)
    ↓
SQLite Adapter (GET /api/reports, GET /api/reports/:id)
```

Components consume the ReportRepository port via REST endpoints. Project selection state is managed via localStorage utilities (CAP-022) and URL deep linking for bookmarkable views.

## NFR Requirements

- Page load < 2s for up to 50 projects
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliant (keyboard navigation, screen reader labels, focus management)
- Responsive layout from 320px to 1920px viewport width
- Dark mode support (system preference detection and manual toggle)

## Personas

- **PER-001** (Engineering Team Lead) — Browses project portfolio to compare assessment scores across repositories and identify teams needing support
- **PER-006** (Non-Technical Stakeholder) — Views maturity badges and overall scores to understand organizational FOE adoption progress
- **PER-002** (Platform Engineer) — Configures project metadata and manages scan history via the API

## Related Capabilities

- **CAP-014** (FOE Report Trend Analysis & History) — Provides historical scan data displayed in the project detail view
- **CAP-001** (FOE Report Generation) — Generates the assessment data that populates project cards and detail tabs
- **CAP-008** (Real-time Streaming) — Powers the SSE-based Chat tab within the project detail view
- **CAP-022** (User State Persistence) — Provides the localStorage utilities for persistent project selection
