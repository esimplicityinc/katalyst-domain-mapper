# CAP-021: DDD Onboarding Tooltips

## Description

The system provides a contextual tooltip system that explains Domain-Driven Design terminology throughout the Domain Mapper UI. Each DDD-specific term (Bounded Context, Aggregate, Value Object, Entity, Domain Event, etc.) is annotated with an unobtrusive info icon that, on hover or focus, displays a popover with a plain-English definition. This capability reduces the learning curve for users unfamiliar with DDD concepts and ensures consistent terminology understanding across the team.

The tooltip system is built around a `DDDTooltip` reusable component and a static `ddd-terms.ts` dictionary containing approximately 15-20 DDD terms with concise definitions, examples, and optional "Learn More" links to deeper reference material. Tooltips are integrated into five view components: Context Map, Aggregates, Events, Workflows, and Glossary — appearing wherever DDD terminology is used in headings, labels, or descriptions.

Tooltips are designed to be non-intrusive: they appear on hover with a slight delay, are keyboard-accessible via focus, and dismiss cleanly without blocking the underlying UI. On mobile, they activate via tap and dismiss on outside tap.

## Key Features

- **DDDTooltip Component**: Reusable info-icon tooltip with hover/focus popover, configurable placement (top, bottom, left, right), and smooth enter/exit transitions
- **Terminology Dictionary**: Static `ddd-terms.ts` module containing ~15-20 DDD terms with plain-English definitions (Bounded Context, Aggregate, Aggregate Root, Entity, Value Object, Domain Event, Command, Query, Repository, Factory, Service, Anti-Corruption Layer, Context Map, Ubiquitous Language, Subdomain)
- **Cross-View Coverage**: Tooltips integrated into Context Map view, Aggregates view, Events view, Workflows view, and Glossary view — appearing next to DDD-specific headings and labels
- **Learn More Links**: Optional deep-dive links for each term pointing to reference material or the Field Guide
- **Dismissable**: Tooltips do not block underlying UI interaction — clicking outside or pressing Escape closes the popover

## Architecture

```

Integrated into View Components:

    ├── AggregatesView.tsx
    ├── EventsView.tsx
    ├── WorkflowsView.tsx
    └── GlossaryView.tsx
```

## NFR Requirements

- WCAG 2.1 AA contrast ratios for tooltip text and background in both light and dark modes
- Keyboard accessible: focusable via Tab, dismissable via Escape, content readable by screen readers via `aria-describedby`
- Dark mode support with appropriate tooltip background and text colors
- Mobile tap support: activate on tap, dismiss on outside tap, no hover dependency on touch devices

## Personas

- **PER-006** (Non-Technical Stakeholder) — Learns DDD concepts in context without leaving the UI, building domain literacy over time
- **PER-005** (Framework Adopter) — Uses tooltips as an onboarding aid when first exploring the Domain Mapper, reducing time-to-productivity
- **PER-007** (Domain Architect) — Validates that tooltip definitions align with established DDD terminology and team-specific ubiquitous language

## Related Capabilities

- **CAP-010** (Interactive Domain Visualization Engine) — Visualization views where tooltips are integrated to explain DDD concepts alongside interactive diagrams
- **CAP-009** (DDD Domain Modeling API) — Provides the domain model data that the tooltip-annotated views display
