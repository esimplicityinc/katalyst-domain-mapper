# CAP-011: Subdomain Classification

## Description

The system supports classifying bounded contexts into DDD subdomain types: Core, Supporting, and Generic. This classification drives visual color coding throughout the UI, informs strategic investment decisions, and provides build-vs-buy recommendations. The subdomain type is stored as a field on bounded contexts via the DDD Domain Modeling API (CAP-009) and rendered consistently across all visualization components (CAP-010).

## Key Features

- **Subdomain Type Field**: `subdomainType` field (core/supporting/generic) on bounded context API model
- **Visual Color Coding**: Consistent colors across context map, context list, and all visualizations (Core=blue, Supporting=green, Generic=gray)
- **Classification Overview**: Summary card showing all contexts grouped by subdomain type with counts
- **Investment Guidance**: Investment level indicators (High/Medium/Low) and build-vs-buy recommendations per subdomain type
- **Team Alignment Hints**: Suggestions for team structure alignment based on subdomain classification

## Personas

- **PER-001** (Engineering Team Lead) — Uses classification to make strategic investment and staffing decisions
- **PER-002** (Platform Engineer) — Sets subdomain types when creating or editing bounded contexts
- **PER-004** (Documentation Author) — Documents subdomain rationale and strategic implications

- **CAP-010** (Interactive Domain Visualization) — Uses subdomain classification for color coding in diagrams
