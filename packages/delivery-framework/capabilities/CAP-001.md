# CAP-001: FOE Report Generation

## Description

The system generates structured JSON reports that assess a repository's Flow Optimized Engineering practices across three dimensions: Understanding (35%), Feedback (35%), and Confidence (30%). Reports include cognitive triangle diagnosis, top strengths, top gaps, and method-linked recommendations.

## Key Features

- Three-dimension scoring with configurable weights
- Cognitive triangle with minimum threshold detection
- Evidence-based findings with file paths and line numbers
- Maturity level classification (Hypothesized, Emerging, Practicing, Optimized)
- Method-linked recommendations from the FOE Field Guide

## Personas

- **PER-001** (Engineering Team Lead) -- Consumes reports to assess team maturity
- **PER-002** (Platform Engineer) -- Builds and maintains the report generation pipeline
- **PER-003** (AI Agent) -- Produces reports via the scanner container
