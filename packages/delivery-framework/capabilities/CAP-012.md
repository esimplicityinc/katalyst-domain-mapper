# CAP-012: Domain Model Export Pipeline

## Description

The system exports the API-backed domain model (CAP-009) into multiple output formats suitable for version control, team communication, and standalone deployment. The export pipeline transforms the structured DDD data into human-readable documentation and interactive sites that work independently of the Katalyst backend.

## Key Features

- **Markdown Export**: Generate a complete set of DDD documentation files matching industry-standard format:
  - `glossary.md` — Ubiquitous language dictionary with code references
  - `subdomains.md` — Core/Supporting/Generic classification with strategic implications
  - `context-map.md` — Bounded context relationships with ASCII art diagram
  - `bounded-contexts.md` — Detailed context descriptions with anti-corruption layers
  - `aggregates.md` — Aggregate roots, invariants, entities, and value objects
  - `domain-events.md` — Event catalog with triggers, effects, and payload schemas
- **Static Site Export**: Generate a standalone Vite + React + Tailwind site pre-populated with domain model data, deployable to any static host (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, S3). Includes interactive context map, aggregate tree, event flow, glossary, and "How It Was Generated" page.
- **JSON Export**: Full domain model as a portable JSON file for consumption by other tools, CI pipelines, or external documentation systems.

## NFR Requirements

- Markdown output must be valid CommonMark with proper heading hierarchy
- Static site must build successfully with `npm run build` and produce `&lt;5MB` output
- JSON export must validate against the DomainModelFull TypeScript type

## Personas

- **PER-001** (Engineering Team Lead) — Exports domain docs for team review and repo commitment
- **PER-002** (Platform Engineer) — Integrates markdown/JSON export into CI pipelines
- **PER-004** (Documentation Author) — Uses markdown export as the basis for polished documentation
- **PER-005** (Framework Adopter) — Generates standalone sites to showcase domain architecture

## Related Capabilities

- **CAP-009** (DDD Domain Modeling API) — Provides the source data for all exports
- **CAP-010** (Interactive Domain Visualization) — Visualization components are reused in static site export
- **CAP-011** (Subdomain Classification) — Classification data is included in markdown and site exports
