# CAP-007: GitHub Integration

## Description

The system provides comprehensive integration with GitHub covering all three FOE dimensions. Inbound: pull Actions/CI workflow data (Feedback), PR descriptions and documentation presence (Understanding), and PR reviews, branch protection rules, and security alerts (Confidence). Outbound: publish governance reports and artifacts to GitHub Pages, wiki, or repository files. Supports both GitHub App (org-wide) and Personal Access Token (individual) authentication.

## Key Features

- GitHub App + Personal Access Token authentication for Cloud and Enterprise
- **Feedback dimension**: Actions workflow runs, deployment frequency, build times, test result artifacts, release cadence, failure rates
- **Understanding dimension**: PR descriptions, commit message quality, README/docs presence, wiki content, ADR patterns, discussion threads
- **Confidence dimension**: PR review quality, branch protection rules, Dependabot/CodeQL alerts, merge policies, required status checks
- Export adapter: publish governance reports to GitHub Pages or wiki
- CLI commands: `github:import --feedback`, `github:import --understanding`, `github:import --confidence`
- Configurable repo/org mapping via `github-config.json`

## Personas

- **PER-001** (Engineering Team Lead) -- Views GitHub-enriched scores across all 3 dimensions
- **PER-002** (Platform Engineer) -- Configures GitHub App/PAT, manages repo mappings, maintains sync
- **PER-003** (AI Agent) -- Consumes GitHub data during scanning for all dimension assessments
