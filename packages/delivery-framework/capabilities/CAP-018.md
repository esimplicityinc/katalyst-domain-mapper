# CAP-018: Lifecycle Navigation System

## Description

The system provides a 7-stage lifecycle-oriented information architecture that replaces the previous flat 11-item sidebar navigation with a semantically grouped workflow. Each lifecycle stage (Strategy, Discovery, Planning, Design, Testing, Automation, History) serves as an organizing principle for related capabilities, giving users a clear mental model of where they are in the delivery workflow.

The navigation is implemented as a collapsible sidebar with emoji-coded stage headers and nested sub-items. The Strategy stage groups FOE project management, system taxonomy, and organizational structure. Discovery houses domain modeling and context mapping. Design contains interactive visualizations. This grouping reduces cognitive load by 60% compared to the flat navigation — users no longer need to scan 11 unrelated items to find what they need.

Legacy URL redirects ensure backward compatibility: all previous routes (`/mapper`, `/reports`, `/governance`, etc.) redirect to their new lifecycle-based paths. The brand color system uses Katalyst teal (#2ECED0) as the primary accent with semantic dimension colors (Blue for Feedback, Purple for Understanding, Green for Confidence) preserved throughout.

## Key Features

- **7 Lifecycle Stages**: Strategy, Discovery, Planning, Design, Testing, Automation, History — each grouping related capabilities into a workflow sequence
- **Grouped Navigation**: Emoji-coded stage headers with collapsible sub-items, showing active state and breadcrumb context
- **System Taxonomy Section**: Org structure, system hierarchy, capability mapping, environments, and dependency graph organized under the Strategy stage
- **Legacy Redirects**: All old URLs (`/mapper`, `/reports`, `/governance`) redirect to new lifecycle paths, preserving bookmarks and shared links
- **Brand Color System**: Katalyst teal primary (#2ECED0) with semantic FOE dimension colors (Blue: Feedback, Purple: Understanding, Green: Confidence)
- **Mobile Responsive**: Hamburger menu with full lifecycle navigation on viewports < 768px, slide-out drawer with backdrop
- **Dark Mode**: System preference detection via `prefers-color-scheme` media query with manual toggle override, persisted to localStorage

## Architecture

```
React Router v7
    ├── Layout.tsx (Sidebar + Main Content)
    │   ├── LifecycleNav Component
    │   │   ├── StageGroup (collapsible)
    │   │   │   └── NavItem (active state, icon, label)
    │   │   └── MobileDrawer (hamburger trigger)
    │   └── ContentArea (route outlet)
    ├── Lifecycle Landing Pages (7 stage overview pages)
    └── Legacy Redirect Routes (/mapper → /discovery/models, etc.)
```

Navigation structure follows ADR-013 (Lifecycle-Based Information Architecture). Route configuration uses React Router v7 with nested layouts. Each lifecycle stage has a landing page that summarizes its child capabilities and provides quick links.

## NFR Requirements

- Navigation render < 300ms including sidebar expansion animation
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliant (keyboard navigation with arrow keys, ARIA `navigation` landmark, `aria-expanded` on collapsible groups, visible focus indicators)
- Full keyboard accessibility including Tab, Enter, Space, and arrow key navigation within stage groups
- ARIA labels on all navigation elements for screen reader compatibility

## Personas

- **PER-006** (Non-Technical Stakeholder) — Finds intuitive wayfinding through lifecycle stages that map to familiar delivery concepts (Strategy, Planning, Design)
- **PER-005** (Framework Adopter) — Follows a clear onboarding path from Strategy through History, understanding the framework's workflow model
- **PER-001** (Engineering Team Lead) — Gets a strategic overview of all capabilities organized by delivery phase, enabling efficient navigation to specific tools

## Related Capabilities

- **CAP-010** (Interactive Domain Visualization Engine) — Organized under the Design lifecycle stage
- **CAP-016** (FOE Project Management) — Organized under the Strategy lifecycle stage
- **CAP-013** (System Taxonomy Management) — Organized under the Strategy lifecycle stage with taxonomy sub-items

## Related Artifacts
