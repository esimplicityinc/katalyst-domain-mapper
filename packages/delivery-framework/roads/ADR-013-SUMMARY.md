## Architecture Decision Record: Lifecycle-Oriented Information Architecture

I've created a comprehensive ADR documenting the decision to reorganize the Katalyst Delivery Framework navigation from a flat 11-item structure to a lifecycle-oriented 7-stage architecture.

## 🎯 Decision Summary

### What We Decided
Reorganize documentation into **7 lifecycle stages**:

```
🎯 Strategy        → Roadmap, System Taxonomy
👥 Discovery       → User Types, User Stories
📋 Planning        → Implementation Plans, System Capabilities
🏗️ Design          → Domain-Driven Design, Architecture Decisions
🧪 Testing         → BDD Tests, Non-Functional Requirements
🤖 Automation      → AI Agents
📝 History         → Change Log
```

### Why This Approach?
✅ **Reduces cognitive load** (7 stages vs 11 flat items)  
✅ **Matches mental models** (Agile, DevOps, Design Thinking)  
✅ **Improves discoverability** (users know which stage to check)  
✅ **Better onboarding** (clear progression Strategy → History)  
✅ **Non-technical accessibility** (plain language + emoji icons)  
✅ **Strategic visibility** (System Taxonomy provides "big picture")  
✅ **Zero content loss** (all existing docs preserved)

## 🔍 Alternatives Analyzed

The ADR thoroughly analyzes **6 alternatives** and explains why each was rejected:

### 1. Domain-Driven Navigation ❌
Group by bounded contexts (Governance, Scanning, Visualization, API)
- **Rejected**: Too technical for non-technical leaders

### 2. Role-Based Navigation ❌
Group by user type (Team Lead, Platform Engineer, AI Agent, etc.)
- **Rejected**: Content duplication, users wear multiple hats

### 3. Alphabetical Navigation ❌
Keep flat structure, sort A-Z
- **Rejected**: No semantic relationships, doesn't scale

### 4. Task-Based Navigation ❌
Group by tasks (Plan, Build, Test, Deploy, Monitor)
- **Rejected**: Missing Discovery and Strategy stages

### 5. Maturity-Based Navigation ❌
Group by governance maturity (Proposed, Validated, Implementing, Complete)
- **Rejected**: Temporal organization is confusing

### 6. Keep Current Structure ❌
Add Taxonomy as 12th item, don't reorganize
- **Rejected**: Makes cognitive overload worse, kicks the can down the road

## 📊 Lifecycle Stage Definitions

Each stage answers a key question:

| Stage | Question | Artifacts |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| **Strategy** | What should we build? Where are we going? | Roadmap, System Taxonomy |
| **Discovery** | Who are we building for? What do they need? | User Types, User Stories |
| **Planning** | How will we build it? What's required? | Plans, Capabilities |
| **Design** | What's the architecture? How is it structured? | DDD Models, ADRs |
| **Testing** | How do we validate? What are quality thresholds? | BDD Tests, NFRs |
| **Automation** | What can be automated? How do agents help? | AI Agents |
| **History** | What have we done? What changed? | Change Log |

## ✨ Key Highlights from ADR-013

### Aligns with Industry Frameworks
- **Agile/Scrum**: Backlog → Sprint → Review → Retro
- **Design Thinking**: Empathize → Define → Ideate → Prototype → Test
- **DevOps**: Plan → Code → Build → Test → Release → Deploy → Operate → Monitor

### Supports All Stakeholder Types
- **Non-Technical Leaders**: Plain language, visual icons, strategic visibility
- **Technical Teams**: Logical grouping, clear progression, taxonomy as source of truth
- **Framework Adopters**: Clear onboarding path, natural workflow

### Mitigates Risks
- **Learning Curve**: Migration guide + announcement bar
- **Extra Click**: Balanced by improved discoverability
- **Broken Bookmarks**: URL redirects
- **Mobile UX**: Standard mobile menu pattern

### BDD Scenarios to Write
```gherkin
Feature: Lifecycle-Oriented Navigation
  As a user of the Katalyst Delivery Framework
  I want to navigate through lifecycle stages
  So that I can find documentation efficiently

  Scenario: Navigate through all 7 lifecycle stages
    Given I am on the homepage
    When I click the "🎯 Strategy" dropdown
    Then I should see "Roadmap" and "System Taxonomy" options
    # ... test all 7 dropdowns

  Scenario: Keyboard navigation through dropdowns
    Given I am on the homepage
    When I press Tab to focus the "🎯 Strategy" dropdown
    And I press Enter to open the dropdown
    And I press Arrow Down to highlight "Roadmap"
    And I press Enter to navigate
    Then I should be on the Roadmap page

  Scenario: Mobile responsive navigation
    Given I am on a mobile device
    When I tap the hamburger menu
    Then I should see all 7 lifecycle stages
    And each stage should be collapsible
```
