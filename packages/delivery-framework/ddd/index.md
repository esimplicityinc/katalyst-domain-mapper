# Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

Comprehensive documentation of the domain model, bounded contexts, and strategic design patterns.

## Overview

This section documents the domain model using Domain-Driven Design principles:

1. **[Domain Overview](./domain-overview.md)** - Vision, core domain, and strategic patterns
2. **[Bounded Contexts](./bounded-contexts.md)** - Domain decomposition and context boundaries
3. **[Ubiquitous Language](./ubiquitous-language.md)** - Shared vocabulary across the team
4. **[Aggregates & Entities](./aggregates-entities.md)** - Consistency boundaries and domain objects
5. **[Value Objects](./value-objects.md)** - Immutable domain primitives
6. **[Domain Events](./domain-events.md)** - Events that capture domain state changes
7. **[Use Cases](./use-cases.md)** - System interactions and workflows
8. **[Context Map](./context-map.md)** - Relationships between bounded contexts

## Why DDD?

Domain-Driven Design helps us:
- **Align code with business** - The codebase reflects real domain concepts
- **Manage complexity** - Bounded contexts isolate concerns
- **Communicate clearly** - Ubiquitous language ensures shared understanding
- **Build maintainable systems** - Clear boundaries enable independent evolution

## Getting Started

Start with the [Domain Overview](./domain-overview.md) to understand the project's domain vision, then explore [Bounded Contexts](./bounded-contexts.md) to see how the domain is decomposed.
