# US-058: Navigate FOE Project Report Sections via Sub-Tabs

**As an** Engineering Team Lead,
**I want to** navigate between FOE report sections using sub-tabs within a project view,
**so that** I can quickly jump between overview, dimensions, triangle, strengths, gaps, and chat without scrolling through a single long page.

## Context

With the transition to a multi-project browser, each project's report needed its own internal navigation. The previous single-page scroll layout made it difficult to find specific sections in a large report. Sub-tabs break the report into focused views — Overview, Dimensions, Triangle, Strengths, Gaps, and Chat — each rendering only the relevant content. This follows the same tabbed navigation pattern used in the Domain Mapper's model views.

## Road Items

- **ROAD-030** (FOE Multi-Project Browser) -- Primary implementation road item

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Six sub-tabs are displayed within the project report view: Overview, Dimensions, Triangle, Strengths, Gaps, and Chat
2. The active tab is visually highlighted with an underline or background color to indicate the current section
3. URL reflects the active tab (e.g., `/strategy/foe-projects?tab=dimensions`) enabling deep linking and sharing
4. Sub-tabs are responsive — horizontal scrolling or collapsing on narrow viewports
