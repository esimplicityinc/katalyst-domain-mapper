# US-046: Filter Glossary Terms by Clickable Tags

**As a** Domain Architect,
**I want to** click on alias tags in the Ubiquitous Language glossary to filter terms by those tags,
**so that** I can quickly find terms related to a specific domain concept or aggregate (e.g., all terms tagged "Citizen" or "User") without scanning the entire list.

## Context

The Glossary view (part of ROAD-009's DDD visualization) displays all ubiquitous language terms with their aliases shown as tag badges. These tags represent cross-references to bounded contexts, aggregates, or domain roles (e.g., "Citizen", "Requester", "User", "Passport Processing"). Currently, these tags are purely visual indicators with no interactivity.

For large domain models with 20+ glossary terms, users need a way to filter by tags to focus on a subset of related terms. This is especially valuable when exploring a specific aggregate or bounded context — clicking the "Passport Processing" tag should show only terms relevant to that context.

This story enhances the existing glossary with clickable tag filtering, following the same multi-select AND logic pattern used in ROAD-033 (Aggregate Tree Filtering). Tags become interactive buttons that toggle filter state, with selected tags highlighted and unselected tags dimmed.

## Differentiation from Other Filtering Stories

US-045 adds full-text search and artifact type filtering to the **Aggregates tree view**. US-046 adds tag-based filtering to the **Glossary view**. Both serve different use cases: US-045 helps find specific aggregates by name/content, US-046 helps find glossary terms by their domain relationships (aliases).

## Road Items

- **ROAD-038** (Filter Glossary Terms by Clickable Tags) -- Primary implementation road item

## Acceptance Criteria

1. All alias tags in the Glossary view are rendered as clickable buttons (styled like pills/badges with hover state)
2. Clicking a tag applies a filter to show only terms that have that alias
3. Clicking multiple tags applies AND logic — the term must have ALL selected tags to be visible
4. Selected tags are visually highlighted (e.g., filled background, darker color) to indicate active filter state
5. Unselected tags remain visible above the term list to show available filter options
6. A "Clear filters" button appears in the header when any tag is active, resetting to show all terms
7. Header subtitle updates to show "Showing X of Y terms" when filters are active
8. Clicking an already-active tag deselects it and removes that filter dimension
9. Filter state is maintained when switching away from the Glossary tab and back within the same session (React state or URL params)
10. Tag buttons render correctly in both light and dark modes with appropriate contrast
11. Tag buttons are focusable via keyboard; Enter or Space key toggles the filter
12. Empty state message ("No terms match the selected filters") appears if filtering results in zero terms
