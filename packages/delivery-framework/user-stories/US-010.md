# US-010: View Governance Dashboard

**As an** Engineering Team Lead,
**I want to** view an interactive governance dashboard,
**so that** I can see road item progress, capability coverage, and cross-reference health at a glance.

## Context

The governance dashboard provides a visual overview of the delivery framework's health. It combines the road item Kanban, capability coverage matrix, and integrity reports into a single view. This is the primary interface for team leads to monitor governance.

## Road Items

- **ROAD-009** (Web Visualization) -- Template 12: Governance Dashboard

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Dashboard displays overall governance health score with artifact counts
2. Road item Kanban board shows items grouped by governance state
3. Capability coverage matrix shows persona count, story count, and road count per capability
4. Cross-reference integrity report lists any broken references
5. DDD context map shows bounded contexts with upstream/downstream arrows
6. Dashboard supports dark mode and responsive layout
7. Data loads from API or static JSON fallback
