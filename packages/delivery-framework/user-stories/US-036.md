# US-036: Browse Domain Events as Flow Timeline

**As an** Engineering Team Lead,
**I want to** see domain events organized as a sequential flow timeline with categories and sync/async filtering,
**so that** I can understand the event chain, identify which events are user-triggered vs batch-processed, and trace cause-and-effect.

## Context

Domain events are central to understanding how bounded contexts communicate. This story adds a flow timeline visualization — similar to the OPR site's EventFlow component — that arranges events in sequential steps with category color coding and sync/async distinction. Events are sourced from the DDD Domain Modeling API (CAP-009) domain events collection.

## Road Items

- **ROAD-018** (Domain Event Flow Visualization)

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Events render as cards arranged in horizontal step groups
2. Step numbers shown above each group
3. Category color coding applied per event (derived from bounded context)
4. Filter buttons: "All", "Synchronous", "Asynchronous" — filtering dims non-matching events
5. Async events display an "ASYNC" badge in the top-right corner
6. Clicking an event opens a detail panel with trigger, effect, timing type, and payload fields
7. Summary grid below the flow shows all events as clickable chips
8. Events can be ordered by a `flowOrder` field (or creation order as fallback)
9. Horizontal scroll when events exceed viewport width
10. Dark mode supported with appropriate color adjustments
