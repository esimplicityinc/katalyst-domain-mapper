# US-009: Advance Road Item Through Governance Gates

**As an** AI Agent,
**I want to** advance ROAD items through the 8-state governance machine,
**so that** each governance gate (ADR, BDD, NFR) is properly satisfied before progression.

## Context

The governance workflow enforces a strict state machine: proposed -> adr_validated -> bdd_pending -> bdd_complete -> implementing -> nfr_validating -> complete. Each transition has preconditions (e.g., ADRs must be validated before moving past `adr_validated`). The agent needs to check and enforce these gates.

## Road Items

- **ROAD-002** (Governance Schemas) -- Defines the state machine transitions
- **ROAD-004** (Parsers & CLI) -- Provides `validate:transitions` command

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Agent can check valid next states for a ROAD item given its current status
2. Transition from `proposed` to `adr_validated` requires `governance.adrs.validated=true`
3. Transition to `bdd_complete` requires `governance.bdd.status=approved`
4. Transition to `complete` requires `governance.nfrs.status=pass`
5. Invalid transitions are rejected with an explanatory error message
6. `validate:transitions` CLI command checks all ROAD items for compliance
7. Agent receives clear guidance on what is needed to advance to the next state
