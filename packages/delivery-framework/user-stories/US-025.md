# US-025: Assess Branch Protection & Security

**As a** Platform Engineer,
**I want to** assess GitHub security features (Dependabot, CodeQL, branch protection) during scanning,
**so that** the Confidence dimension score reflects the security posture and vulnerability management practices.

## Context

GitHub provides built-in security tooling — Dependabot for dependency vulnerabilities, CodeQL for code scanning, and branch protection for enforcing quality gates. Assessing these during scanning provides a comprehensive view of the team's security practices, which is a key component of the Confidence dimension.

## Road Items

- **ROAD-014** (GitHub Confidence Integration) -- Primary implementation road item

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Dependabot alerts are imported with severity, status, and resolution time
2. CodeQL/code scanning alerts are imported with severity and status
3. Security alert resolution rate is calculated (% resolved within SLA)
4. Mean time to remediate security alerts is calculated
5. Required status checks are assessed for presence and configuration
6. Commit signing requirements are assessed
7. Imported signals feed into the scanner's Confidence dimension scoring
8. Repos without security features get specific gap recommendations
