# US-071: Fix Triangle Tab Rendering for Rich belowMinimum Format

**As an** Engineering Team Lead,
**I want to** view the Triangle tab without crashes regardless of the belowMinimum data format in my FOE report,
**so that** I can always see my cognitive triangle diagnosis without encountering rendering errors.

## Context

The Cognitive Triangle tab visualizes which FOE dimensions fall below their minimum thresholds. The original implementation assumed `belowMinimum` was always a simple boolean. However, newer FOE scanner versions produce a rich object format containing the dimension name, actual score, and minimum threshold — providing more useful diagnostic information. When a report with the rich format was loaded, the Triangle tab crashed with a rendering error because the component tried to use the object as a boolean. The fix normalizes both formats, rendering the triangle correctly regardless of whether `belowMinimum` is a boolean or a structured object.

## Road Items

- N/A (Bug fix, no dedicated road item)

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Triangle tab renders correctly when `belowMinimum` data is in the rich object format (containing `dimension`, `score`, and `minimum` fields)
2. Triangle tab renders correctly when `belowMinimum` data is in the simple boolean format (backward compatibility)
3. No crash, white screen, or console error occurs on any valid FOE report JSON regardless of `belowMinimum` format variation
