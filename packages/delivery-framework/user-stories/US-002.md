# US-002: Track Governance Health Over Time

**As an** Engineering Team Lead,
**I want to** compare governance snapshots over time,
**so that** I can measure whether our governance practices are improving.

## Context

Each time the governance index is built and ingested via the API, a snapshot is stored. The team lead needs trend visualization to see if road items are progressing, if referential integrity is improving, and if coverage gaps are being addressed.

## Road Items

- **ROAD-005** (API Governance Domain) -- Provides snapshot storage and trend endpoints
- **ROAD-009** (Web Visualization) -- Provides the trend UI

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Team lead can view a list of governance snapshots ordered by date
2. Trend chart shows governance scores over time
3. Referential integrity error count is tracked per snapshot
4. Road item status distribution is visible per snapshot
5. Comparison between any two snapshots highlights improvements and regressions
