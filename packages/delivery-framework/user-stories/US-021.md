# US-021: Track Deployment Frequency via GitHub

**As an** Engineering Team Lead,
**I want to** track deployment frequency from GitHub Releases and Deployments,
**so that** the Feedback dimension score includes DORA-aligned deployment frequency metrics.

## Context

Deployment frequency is a key DORA metric and a critical Feedback dimension signal. GitHub tracks both Releases (tagged versions) and Deployments (environment-specific). Importing this data provides real deployment cadence metrics rather than relying on CI config analysis alone.

## Road Items

- **ROAD-012** (GitHub Feedback Integration) -- Primary implementation road item

## Acceptance Criteria

1. GitHub Releases are imported and counted over configurable time windows
2. GitHub Deployments API data is imported with environment and status
3. Deployment frequency is calculated (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly)
4. Release cadence trends are calculated across time windows
5. DORA deployment frequency classification is derived (elite, high, medium, low)
6. Imported metrics feed into the scanner's Feedback dimension scoring
7. CLI command `github:import --feedback` includes deployment data
8. Repos without releases/deployments get a zero-score with explanation
