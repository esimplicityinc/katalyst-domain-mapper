# US-018: Sync Documentation to Confluence

**As a** Platform Engineer,
**I want to** publish governance reports, roadmaps, and DDD artifacts to Confluence,
**so that** the wider team has visibility into governance health in their existing documentation platform.

## Context

Teams use Confluence as their documentation hub. Publishing governance artifacts there ensures visibility without requiring access to the delivery framework's Docusaurus site. This requires converting markdown governance artifacts and JSON reports into Confluence storage format (XHTML), managing page hierarchies, and handling versioning.

## Road Items

- **ROAD-011** (Confluence Bidirectional Integration) -- Primary implementation road item

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Governance reports are published to a configured Confluence space as formatted pages
2. Roadmap items are synced as a Confluence table page with status indicators
3. DDD context maps and aggregate documentation are published as Confluence pages
4. Capability coverage matrix is published as a Confluence page with live data
5. Published pages include governance metadata (last scan date, scores, version)
6. Sync is idempotent — re-running updates existing pages rather than creating duplicates
7. Page versioning is preserved — each sync creates a new Confluence page version
8. CLI command `confluence:sync --export` pushes governance docs to Confluence
9. Confluence space and page hierarchy is configurable via `confluence-config.json`
