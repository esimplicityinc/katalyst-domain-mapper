# US-070: View FOE Projects Card on Strategy Landing Page

**As an** Engineering Team Lead,
**I want to** see a FOE Projects card on the Strategy landing page,
**so that** I have a clear entry point to the FOE project browser from the Strategy overview.

## Context

The Strategy landing page serves as a dashboard for all strategic tools — taxonomy, FOE scanning, and organizational structure. After the FOE multi-project browser was built (US-056) and relocated under the Strategy lifecycle stage (US-062), there was no visual entry point on the Strategy landing page itself. Users had to know to click the sidebar nav item. A FOE Projects card now appears on the Strategy page, showing a summary (project count and latest scan date) and linking directly to the project browser. This provides discoverability and at-a-glance status.

## Road Items

- **ROAD-040** (Lifecycle Navigation Redesign) -- Primary implementation road item

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A FOE Projects card is visible on the Strategy landing page alongside other strategy tools
2. The card displays the total project count and the date of the most recent scan
3. The card links directly to `/strategy/foe-projects` when clicked
