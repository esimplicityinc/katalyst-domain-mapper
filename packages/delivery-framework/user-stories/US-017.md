# US-017: Import Jira Metrics for Scanning

**As an** Engineering Team Lead,
**I want to** import Jira project metrics into the scanner,
**so that** the Feedback dimension score reflects real delivery data (cycle time, velocity, WIP) rather than only repository-derived signals.

## Context

The current scanner assesses the Feedback dimension from CI/CD config files and test results found in the repository. Many delivery metrics — sprint velocity, cycle time, WIP limits, deployment frequency — live in Jira. Importing this data significantly enriches the Feedback dimension assessment.

## Road Items

- **ROAD-010** (Jira Bidirectional Integration) -- Primary implementation road item

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Jira sprint data (velocity, burndown, completion rate) is imported via REST API
2. Cycle time and lead time are calculated from Jira issue transitions
3. WIP limits and board configuration are extracted from Jira boards
4. Deployment frequency is derived from Jira release data when available
5. Imported metrics feed into the scanner's Feedback dimension scoring
6. CLI command `jira:import` pulls metrics without requiring full sync
7. Scanner agent can request Jira metrics during FOE assessment
8. Missing or inaccessible Jira data degrades gracefully (zero-score with explanation)
