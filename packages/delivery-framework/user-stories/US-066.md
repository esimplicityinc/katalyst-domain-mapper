# US-066: Persist Domain Model Selection Across Page Refresh

**As an** Engineering Team Lead,
**I want to** have my selected domain model remembered across page refreshes,
**so that** I don't lose context when the browser reloads or I navigate away and return.

## Context

The Domain Mapper allowed selecting from multiple domain models, but a page refresh always reset the selection to the first model in the list. This was disorienting for users working with a specific model — every refresh required re-navigating to their model. The selected model ID is now persisted in localStorage and restored on page load. Additionally, URL-based deep linking allows sharing a direct link to a specific model. This mirrors the same persistence pattern applied to FOE project selection (US-057).

## Road Items

- **ROAD-029** (Domain Model Selection Persistence) -- Primary implementation road item

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Selected domain model ID is stored in localStorage when a model is selected
2. On page reload, the previously selected model is automatically re-selected and its views displayed
3. If the stored model ID references a model that has been deleted, the app gracefully falls back to the model list
4. URL-based deep linking to a specific model is supported (e.g., `/design/domain-mapper?model=abc-123`)
