# US-020: Import GitHub Actions Metrics

**As an** Engineering Team Lead,
**I want to** import GitHub Actions workflow metrics into the scanner,
**so that** the Feedback dimension score reflects real CI/CD performance data (build times, failure rates, test results).

## Context

The current scanner assesses the Feedback dimension from CI config files found in the repository. GitHub Actions provides rich runtime data — workflow execution times, failure rates, and test result artifacts — that significantly enriches this assessment with actual performance data rather than just configuration analysis.

## Road Items

- **ROAD-012** (GitHub Feedback Integration) -- Primary implementation road item

## Acceptance Criteria

1. GitHub Actions workflow runs are imported via REST/GraphQL API
2. Build times (p50, p90, p99) are calculated from workflow run durations
3. Build failure rate is calculated from workflow run conclusions
4. Mean time to recovery is calculated from consecutive failure/success transitions
5. Test result artifacts are downloaded and parsed from workflow runs
6. Imported metrics feed into the scanner's Feedback dimension scoring
7. CLI command `github:import --feedback` pulls Actions data
8. Missing or inaccessible GitHub data degrades gracefully (zero-score with explanation)
