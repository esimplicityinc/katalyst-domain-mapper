# US-011: Score Governance Maturity During Scan

**As an** AI Agent (scanner governance specialist),
**I want to** assess governance maturity during FOE scans,
**so that** the scan report includes governance health alongside architecture, testing, and documentation scores.

## Context

The FOE scanner dispatches specialist agents in parallel. The governance agent is the 6th specialist, assessing governance artifacts (capabilities, personas, road items, ADRs, DDD model) and feeding findings into the Understanding dimension.

## Road Items

- **ROAD-006** (Scanner Governance Agent) -- Primary implementation road item

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Governance scanner agent produces 4 subscores (0-25 each, 0-100 total)
2. Artifact Completeness subscore counts present artifact types with valid frontmatter
3. Cross-Reference Integrity subscore validates all ID references resolve
4. State Machine Compliance subscore checks governance blocks match road item status
5. DDD Model Quality subscore assesses bounded context, aggregate, and event documentation
6. Findings include evidence (file paths), impact, and method-linked recommendations
7. Agent returns graceful zero-score when no governance artifacts are found
