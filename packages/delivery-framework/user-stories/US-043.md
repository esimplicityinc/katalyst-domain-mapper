# US-043: Import Roadmap from GitHub Projects

**As a** Platform Engineer,
**I want to** import roadmap items from a GitHub Projects v2 board into the governance pipeline,
**so that** the team can manage the roadmap in GitHub Projects (their existing tool) while Katalyst tracks governance compliance, validation status, and visualization automatically.

## Context

Many teams use GitHub Projects v2 for roadmap planning — it integrates natively with issues, PRs, and milestones. Requiring a separate `ROADMAP.mdx` file creates duplication and drift. By treating GitHub Projects as an external roadmap source, we eliminate double-maintenance. GitHub Projects items map to ROAD items using the Projects v2 GraphQL API, and the governance pipeline processes them identically to locally-authored items.

This builds on the GitHub API client and authentication infrastructure from ROAD-012/013/014 (GitHub integrations), adding a new use case: reading GitHub Projects boards as the roadmap source of truth rather than just importing CI/docs/security metrics.

## Road Items

- **ROAD-026** (External Roadmap Source: Jira & GitHub Projects) -- Primary implementation road item
- **ROAD-012** (GitHub Feedback Integration) -- Provides GitHub API client and auth infrastructure

## Acceptance Criteria

1. GitHub Projects v2 items from a configured project are imported as ROAD-XXX items
2. GitHub Projects status field (single select) maps to governance state machine states:
   - "Todo" / "Backlog" -> `proposed`
   - "In Progress" -> `implementing`
   - "Done" -> `complete`
   - Custom status values configurable via `roadmap-source.json`
3. GitHub Projects priority field (custom single select) maps to ROAD priority (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
4. GitHub Issues linked to project items map to ROAD item task lists; issue task lists (`- [ ]`) map to subtasks
5. GitHub Projects custom fields (iteration, phase, labels) map to ROAD phase, capabilities, and dependencies
6. Field mapping is fully configurable via `roadmap-source.json`
7. Sync engine detects new, changed, and removed items; produces a diff report
8. External tool (GitHub Projects) is source of truth; locally modified items are flagged as "drift"
9. CLI command `roadmap:import --source github` runs the import
10. CLI command `roadmap:diff --source github` previews changes without applying
11. Imported ROAD items produce identical `governance-index.json` output to locally-authored ROADMAP.mdx
12. Dashboard shows "Source: GitHub Projects" indicator when roadmap is externally sourced
13. GitHub Projects v2 GraphQL API used for reading project data (not REST v3)
14. Missing or inaccessible GitHub data degrades gracefully with clear error messages
