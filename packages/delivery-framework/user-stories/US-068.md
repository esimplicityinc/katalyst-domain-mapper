# US-068: Configure Pre-commit Quality Hooks

**As a** DevOps/CI Engineer,
**I want to** have automated quality checks run before every commit and push,
**so that** code quality issues are caught at the developer's machine before reaching the CI pipeline.

## Context

The repository had no automated quality gates at the local development level. Developers could commit code with linting errors, formatting inconsistencies, and failing tests — only discovering these issues minutes later when CI failed. This created a slow, frustrating feedback loop. Husky pre-commit hooks now run linting and formatting checks before every commit, and pre-push hooks run the test suite before code leaves the developer's machine. A configurable light vs. full mode allows developers to choose fast checks for routine commits or comprehensive checks before pushing.

## Road Items

- N/A (DevOps improvement, no dedicated road item)

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Husky is installed and configured in the repository with hooks in `.husky/` directory
2. Pre-commit hook runs linting and formatting checks, blocking the commit if violations are found
3. Pre-push hook runs the test suite, blocking the push if tests fail
4. Hook intensity is configurable between light mode (lint + format only, fast) and full mode (lint + format + tests, comprehensive)
