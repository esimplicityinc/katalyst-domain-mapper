# US-060: Navigate Documentation by Delivery Lifecycle Stages

**As a** Non-Technical Stakeholder,
**I want to** navigate the documentation organized by delivery lifecycle stages,
**so that** I can find relevant content by understanding where it fits in the delivery process rather than memorizing technical categories.

## Context

The original documentation sidebar was a flat list of 11 navigation items with no grouping or hierarchy. This worked for developers who knew the system but was impenetrable for non-technical stakeholders, new team members, and framework adopters. The navigation has been reorganized around 7 delivery lifecycle stages — Strategy, Discovery, Planning, Design, Testing, Automation, and History — that map to how teams actually work. Each stage groups related content (e.g., "Design" contains Domain Mapper and DDD tools, "Strategy" contains FOE Scanner and Taxonomy). This makes the documentation self-orienting: users can find content by asking "what stage of delivery am I in?" rather than guessing internal system names.

## Road Items

- **ROAD-040** (Lifecycle Navigation Redesign) -- Primary implementation road item

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Sidebar navigation organizes all content under 7 lifecycle stages: Strategy, Discovery, Planning, Design, Testing, Automation, and History
2. Each lifecycle stage has an emoji icon for quick visual identification (e.g., compass for Strategy, magnifying glass for Discovery)
3. Lifecycle stage sections are collapsible in the sidebar, defaulting to expanded for the active stage
4. Navigation is mobile responsive with a hamburger menu on small screens
5. All navigation items have ARIA labels for screen reader accessibility
6. Legacy flat-nav URLs (e.g., `/reports`) redirect to their new lifecycle-based paths (e.g., `/strategy/foe-scanner`) for backward compatibility
