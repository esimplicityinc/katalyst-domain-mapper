# US-003: Create Governance Zod Schemas

**As a** Platform Engineer,
**I want to** create Zod validation schemas for all governance artifact types,
**so that** we have a single source of truth for artifact validation that replaces hand-written JS scripts.

## Context

Currently, governance validation is done by `governance-linter.js` with ad-hoc regex checks and hardcoded arrays. Moving to Zod schemas provides runtime validation + TypeScript types from a single definition, enabling type-safe validation across the entire pipeline.

## Road Items

- **ROAD-002** (Governance Zod Schemas) -- Primary implementation road item

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Zod schemas exist for all 7 governance artifact types
2. Each schema exports both the Zod object and inferred TypeScript type
3. ID patterns validate format (e.g., `CAP-XXX`, `ROAD-XXX`, `PER-XXX`)
4. RoadItem schema encodes the 8-state governance machine as a Zod enum
5. GovernanceIndexSchema defines the shape of the built index with reverse indices
6. All schemas pass unit tests with valid and invalid fixture data
7. Existing `@foe/schemas` build succeeds with the new governance module
