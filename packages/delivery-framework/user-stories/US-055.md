# US-055: Create Manual FOE Assessment

**As an** Engineering Team Lead or Consultant,
**I want to** create an FOE assessment manually through a guided wizard,
**so that** I can evaluate engineering practices without requiring code access or automated scanning.

## Context

Not all FOE assessments require or benefit from automated repository scanning. Manual assessment is valuable when:
- Code access is restricted (client engagements, proprietary systems)
- Initial baseline assessment before committing to automation
- Small projects where scanning overhead isn't justified
- Educational/training scenarios to learn FOE dimensions
- Rapid comparative analysis across multiple teams

The manual assessment wizard provides the same structured scoring framework as automated scans, ensuring consistency and enabling comparison with scanned repositories.

## Road Items

- **ROAD-043** (Manual Assessment Wizard UI) -- Implements this story

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Access**: User can access wizard from FOE Reports homepage via prominent CTA
2. **Progress**: Wizard shows clear 7-step flow with progress indicator
3. **Guidance**: Each dimension step includes:
   - Assessment criteria checklist
   - Scoring rubric (0-25 / 26-50 / 51-75 / 76-100 ranges)
   - Examples of what constitutes each score range
4. **Scoring**: Visual sliders with real-time numeric display (0-100)
5. **Calculations**: Overall score auto-calculates (35% Feedback + 35% Understanding + 30% Confidence)
6. **Findings**: Can add multiple strengths and gaps with descriptions
7. **Recommendations**: Can add prioritized recommendations
8. **Review**: Summary page shows all inputs before export
9. **Export**: Downloads valid JSON matching FOEReport schema
10. **Integration**: Exported report loads correctly in all 11 visualization templates
11. **Performance**: Wizard completes in &lt;10 minutes for experienced users
12. **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigable, WCAG 2.1 AA compliant

## Related Capabilities

- **CAP-015** (Manual FOE Assessment Creation) -- Core capability
- **CAP-001** (FOE Report Generation) -- Schema compatibility
- **CAP-002** (FOE Report Visualization) -- Display generated reports

## Related User Stories

- **US-001** (View FOE Scan Report) -- Consumer of manual assessments
- **US-030** (Compare FOE Reports) -- Compare manual vs automated assessments

## Benefits

- **Accessibility**: FOE framework available without code access
- **Speed**: Faster than scanning for small projects or initial baselines
- **Education**: Hands-on learning tool for FOE dimensions
- **Flexibility**: Works for any project regardless of tech stack
- **Consistency**: Same scoring framework as automated scans

## Technical Notes

- **Frontend only**: No API endpoints required
- **Schema reuse**: Uses existing `FOEReportSchema` from `@foe/schemas`
- **Validation**: Real-time Zod validation before export
- **Storage**: Consider localStorage for in-progress state (future enhancement)

## Open Questions

1. Should we support importing/editing existing JSON reports?
2. Should we allow customizing dimension weights?
3. Should we save in-progress assessments automatically?
4. Should we add collaboration features (multi-user scoring)?
