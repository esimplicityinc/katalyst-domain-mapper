# US-016: Sync Governance Artifacts to Jira

**As a** Platform Engineer,
**I want to** sync governance artifacts (ROAD items, user stories, capabilities) to Jira,
**so that** the team can manage governance work in their existing Jira project management workflow.

## Context

Teams already use Jira for project management. Rather than requiring them to switch contexts to a separate governance system, we push governance artifacts to Jira as issues. This requires mapping our governance state machine (8 states) to Jira workflow statuses, and handling bidirectional updates when items change in either system.

## Road Items

- **ROAD-010** (Jira Bidirectional Integration) -- Primary implementation road item

## Acceptance Criteria

1. ROAD items can be pushed to Jira as issues with correct status mapping
2. User stories are synced as Jira issues linked to their ROAD item epic
3. Capabilities are synced as Jira epics or labels for grouping
4. Jira custom fields map to governance frontmatter (priority, phase, status)
5. Sync is idempotent — re-running does not create duplicates
6. Conflict resolution handles concurrent edits in both systems
7. CLI command `jira:sync --export` pushes governance artifacts to Jira
8. Jira project and field mapping is configurable via `jira-config.json`
