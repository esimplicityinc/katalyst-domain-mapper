# US-013: Validate Documentation Frontmatter

**As a** Documentation Author,
**I want to** validate my documentation frontmatter before committing,
**so that** I catch schema errors and broken cross-references early in the authoring process.

## Context

Documentation authors write markdown files with YAML frontmatter that must conform to specific schemas. Without validation, errors are only caught at build time or not at all. Early validation during authoring provides fast feedback and prevents broken artifacts from being committed.

## Road Items

- **ROAD-004** (Parsers & CLI) -- Provides `validate:governance` command

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Running `validate:governance` catches invalid frontmatter in any documentation file
2. Error messages identify the specific file, field, and validation rule that failed
3. Validation covers governance artifacts (ROAD, ADR, CAP, PER) and DDD artifacts
4. A single file can be validated in isolation for quick feedback
5. Validation runs in under 2 seconds for incremental single-file checks
6. Output is human-readable with colored terminal output
