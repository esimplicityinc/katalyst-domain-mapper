# US-019: Import Confluence Content for Scanning

**As an** Engineering Team Lead,
**I want to** import Confluence wiki content into the scanner,
**so that** the Understanding dimension score reflects real documentation quality (freshness, coverage, ADRs) rather than only repository-derived signals.

## Context

The current scanner assesses the Understanding dimension from in-repo documentation (README, ADRs, doc comments). Many teams maintain significant documentation in Confluence — architecture decisions, runbooks, onboarding guides, design docs. Importing this content significantly enriches the Understanding dimension assessment.

## Road Items

- **ROAD-011** (Confluence Bidirectional Integration) -- Primary implementation road item

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Confluence pages tagged as ADRs are imported and mapped to governance ADR artifacts
2. Runbook pages are imported and assessed for operational documentation coverage
3. Design documentation pages are imported and assessed for architecture documentation quality
4. Documentation freshness is measured from Confluence page last-modified dates
5. Documentation coverage is calculated as a percentage of expected doc types present
6. Imported content feeds into the scanner's Understanding dimension scoring
7. CLI command `confluence:import` pulls content without requiring full sync
8. Scanner agent can request Confluence content during FOE assessment
9. Missing or inaccessible Confluence data degrades gracefully (zero-score with explanation)
