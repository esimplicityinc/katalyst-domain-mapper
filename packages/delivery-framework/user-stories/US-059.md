# US-059: Chat with AI Coach About FOE Assessment Results

**As an** Engineering Team Lead,
**I want to** chat with an AI coach that understands my project's FOE assessment results,
**so that** I can get contextual advice on improving my team's engineering practices based on actual scan data.

## Context

FOE scan reports provide scores, findings, gaps, and recommendations — but interpreting them requires domain expertise in Flow Optimized Engineering. Rather than leaving users to decode the report alone, an AI chat agent is embedded directly in the project report view. The agent receives the full report context (all dimension scores, findings, gaps, and recommendations) so it can provide targeted, specific guidance. Starter suggestions help users who aren't sure what to ask, and SSE streaming provides a responsive conversational experience.

## Road Items

- **ROAD-031** (FOE AI Coach Chat) -- Primary implementation road item

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A Chat tab is available within the FOE project report view alongside Overview, Dimensions, Triangle, Strengths, and Gaps tabs
2. Chat responses stream in real-time via Server-Sent Events (SSE) for a responsive conversational experience
3. The AI agent receives the full FOE report context — dimension scores, sub-scores, findings, gaps, and recommendations — enabling contextual answers
4. Four starter suggestion prompts are displayed before the first message to guide users (e.g., "What should we improve first?", "Explain our confidence score")
5. Follow-up questions work correctly within the same conversation, maintaining chat history
6. Chat interface renders correctly in dark mode with appropriate message bubble contrast
