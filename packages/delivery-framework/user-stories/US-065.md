# US-065: View DDD Terminology Tooltips in Domain Mapper

**As a** Non-Technical Stakeholder,
**I want to** see plain-English tooltips explaining DDD terminology in the Domain Mapper,
**so that** I can understand terms like "Bounded Context", "Aggregate", and "Domain Event" without needing prior DDD knowledge.

## Context

The Domain Mapper uses Domain-Driven Design terminology throughout its interface — Bounded Contexts, Aggregates, Domain Events, Ubiquitous Language, and Workflows. For DDD practitioners these are second nature, but for non-technical stakeholders, product managers, and newcomers these terms are opaque jargon that creates a learning barrier. Small info icons have been added next to each DDD term, revealing a popover with a concise, plain-English definition on hover. This makes the Domain Mapper self-documenting and accessible to a broader audience without cluttering the interface for experienced users.

## Road Items

- **ROAD-028** (DDD Terminology Tooltips) -- Primary implementation road item

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Info icons (ⓘ) appear next to DDD terms throughout the Domain Mapper interface
2. Hovering over an info icon shows a popover with a plain-English definition of the term
3. Tooltips are present in all 5 Domain Mapper views: Context Map, Aggregates, Events, Workflows, and Glossary
4. Tooltips render correctly in dark mode with appropriate background and text contrast
5. Tooltips are dismissable by clicking outside the popover or pressing the Escape key
