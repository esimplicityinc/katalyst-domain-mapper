# US-023: Publish Governance to GitHub

**As a** Platform Engineer,
**I want to** publish governance reports and artifacts to GitHub (Pages, wiki, issues),
**so that** governance health is visible directly in the repository where the team works.

## Context

Teams work in GitHub daily. Publishing governance artifacts directly to GitHub Pages (static reports), wiki (narrative documentation), and Issues (ROAD item tracking) ensures governance visibility without requiring access to a separate documentation site or dashboard.

## Road Items

- **ROAD-013** (GitHub Understanding Integration) -- Primary implementation road item

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Governance reports are published to GitHub Pages as static HTML
2. Governance summary is published as a GitHub wiki page
3. ROAD item status can be synced to GitHub Issues with labels
4. Governance badge (SVG) is generated for README embedding
5. Published content includes last scan date, scores, and maturity level
6. Sync is idempotent — re-running updates existing pages/issues
7. CLI command `github:sync --export` pushes governance artifacts
8. GitHub repo, org, and pages configuration is via `github-config.json`
