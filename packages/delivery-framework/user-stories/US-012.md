# US-012: Author DDD Domain Model Docs

**As a** Documentation Author,
**I want to** write structured DDD documentation with validated frontmatter,
**so that** the domain model is formally defined, cross-referenced, and renderable on the docs site.

## Context

DDD knowledge is currently scattered across agent prompts and informal documentation. Formalizing it into validated markdown files with frontmatter makes the model inspectable by tooling, cross-referenceable by the governance index builder, and visualizable on the context map.

## Road Items

- **ROAD-003** (DDD Schemas) -- Schema definitions for DDD artifacts
- **ROAD-004** (Parsers & CLI) -- Parsers for DDD markdown files

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Bounded context markdown files have validated frontmatter (slug, responsibility, communication pattern)
2. Aggregate files define root entity, invariants, commands, and emitted events
3. Value object files specify properties with types, constraints, and validation rules
4. Domain event files document payload fields, source aggregate, and subscriber contexts
5. Cross-references between DDD artifacts are validated at build time
6. Docusaurus site renders DDD docs with sidebar navigation
7. Context map page shows upstream/downstream relationships
