# US-026: Stream Agent Responses via SSE

**As a** Platform Engineer,
**I want to** stream agent responses via Server-Sent Events,
**so that** clients receive output immediately as the agent generates it rather than waiting for the full response.

## Context

Scanner operations take 5-15 minutes. Governance validation can take 30+ seconds for large projects. Currently, clients must wait for the entire operation to complete before seeing any output. SSE streaming eliminates this latency by pushing incremental results as they're generated, providing immediate feedback and a sense of progress.

## Road Items

- **ROAD-015** (SSE Streaming for Real-time Agent Responses) -- Primary implementation road item

## Acceptance Criteria

1. `GET /api/v1/stream/:sessionId` returns `Content-Type: text/event-stream`
2. Agent text output is delivered as `agent:chunk` events with incremental content
3. Phase transitions are delivered as `agent:status` events with status payload
4. Stream completes with an `agent:complete` event containing the final result
5. Errors are delivered as `agent:error` events with error details
6. Reconnection is supported via `Last-Event-ID` header for resumable streams
7. Heartbeat events are sent every 15 seconds to keep the connection alive
8. Maximum concurrent SSE connections is configurable (default: 100)
9. Stream timeout is configurable (default: 30 minutes for long-running scans)
