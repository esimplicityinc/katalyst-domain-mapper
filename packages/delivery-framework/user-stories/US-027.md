# US-027: View Live Agent Progress in UI

**As an** Engineering Team Lead,
**I want to** see live agent output in the web UI as a scan progresses,
**so that** I get immediate feedback during long-running scans instead of waiting 5-15 minutes for a blank page to finally load.

## Context

The current web UI requires a completed JSON report to display anything. During a 5-15 minute scan, the user sees nothing. With SSE streaming, the UI can show which agent is running, display partial findings as they're discovered, and render the final report instantly upon completion. This dramatically improves the perceived performance and user experience.

## Road Items

- **ROAD-015** (SSE Streaming for Real-time Agent Responses) -- Primary implementation road item

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Scanner output appears in the web UI as the agent generates it (no full-page reload)
2. A progress indicator shows which scanner agent is currently active
3. Text chunks render incrementally (typewriter-style or block append)
4. Status transitions (e.g., "Scanning CI..." → "Scanning tests...") update in real-time
5. If the connection drops, the UI automatically reconnects and resumes from last event
6. The final report renders immediately when the `agent:complete` event arrives
7. Error states display a clear message with retry option
8. Multiple concurrent scans can be monitored from a scan dashboard
