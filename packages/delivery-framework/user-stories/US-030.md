# US-030: Compare FOE Reports to Track Improvement

**As an** Engineering Team Lead,
**I want to** compare two FOE scan reports side-by-side,
**so that** I can measure improvement over time and verify that interventions are working.

## Context

After running multiple scans on the same repository, the team lead needs to see what changed between assessments. The comparison endpoint calculates deltas across all dimensions and identifies which gaps were resolved and which new ones appeared.

## Road Items

- **ROAD-001** (Import Governance Infrastructure) -- Report comparison is part of report generation capability

## Acceptance Criteria

1. `GET /api/v1/reports/:id/compare/:otherId` returns a `ReportComparison` object
2. `scoreDelta` is the difference in overall scores (positive = improvement)
3. `dimensionDeltas` shows per-dimension changes
4. `maturityChange` shows from/to maturity levels (or null if unchanged)
5. `newGaps` and `resolvedGaps` identify what changed
6. Returns 404 if either report ID is invalid
