# US-042: Import Roadmap from Jira Epics and Boards

**As a** Platform Engineer,
**I want to** import roadmap items from Jira epics and boards into the governance pipeline,
**so that** the team can manage the roadmap in Jira (their existing tool) while Katalyst tracks governance compliance, validation status, and visualization automatically.

## Context

Teams already maintain project plans in Jira. Requiring them to also maintain a `ROADMAP.mdx` file creates duplication and drift. By treating Jira as an external roadmap source, we eliminate the double-maintenance problem. Jira epics map naturally to ROAD items (status, priority, subtasks as task lists), and the governance pipeline processes them identically to locally-authored items.

This builds on the Jira API client and authentication infrastructure from ROAD-010 (Jira Bidirectional Integration), adding a new use case: reading Jira project boards as the roadmap source of truth rather than just syncing metrics.

## Road Items

- **ROAD-026** (External Roadmap Source: Jira & GitHub Projects) -- Primary implementation road item
- **ROAD-010** (Jira Bidirectional Integration) -- Provides Jira API client and auth infrastructure

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Jira epics from a configured project/board are imported as ROAD-XXX items
2. Jira epic status maps to governance state machine states:
   - "To Do" / "Backlog" -> `proposed`
   - "In Progress" -> `implementing`
   - "Done" -> `complete`
   - Custom statuses configurable via `roadmap-source.json`
3. Jira priority (Highest, High, Medium, Low, Lowest) maps to ROAD priority (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
4. Jira subtasks / child issues map to ROAD item task lists with appropriate status emojis
5. Jira labels or custom fields map to ROAD phase, capabilities, and dependencies
6. Field mapping is fully configurable via `roadmap-source.json`
7. Sync engine detects new, changed, and removed items; produces a diff report
8. External tool (Jira) is source of truth; locally modified items are flagged as "drift"
9. CLI command `roadmap:import --source jira` runs the import
10. CLI command `roadmap:diff --source jira` previews changes without applying
11. Imported ROAD items produce identical `governance-index.json` output to locally-authored ROADMAP.mdx
12. Dashboard shows "Source: Jira" indicator when roadmap is externally sourced
13. Missing or inaccessible Jira data degrades gracefully with clear error messages
