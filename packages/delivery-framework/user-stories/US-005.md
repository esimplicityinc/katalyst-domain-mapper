# US-005: Ingest Governance Snapshot via API

**As a** Platform Engineer,
**I want to** ingest governance index snapshots via the API,
**so that** governance state is persisted and queryable for trend tracking and dashboard visualization.

## Context

The governance index JSON produced by the CLI needs to be stored persistently for trend tracking. The API provides RESTful endpoints following the existing hexagonal architecture pattern (port -> adapter -> use case -> route).

## Road Items

- **ROAD-005** (API Governance Domain) -- Primary implementation road item

## Acceptance Criteria

1. `POST /api/v1/governance` accepts a governance-index.json payload
2. Payload is validated against GovernanceIndexSchema before storage
3. Snapshot is stored with a UUID, project name, and timestamp
4. `GET /api/v1/governance` returns the latest snapshot for a project
5. `GET /api/v1/governance/snapshots` lists all snapshots for trend tracking
6. `GET /api/v1/governance/:id/coverage` returns capability coverage analysis
7. API response time is under 200ms for all governance queries
