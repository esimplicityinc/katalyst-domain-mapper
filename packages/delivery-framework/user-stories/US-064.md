# US-064: Manage Taxonomy Nodes via CRUD API

**As a** Platform Engineer,
**I want to** manage taxonomy entities through incremental CRUD API operations,
**so that** I can add, update, and remove individual taxonomy nodes without regenerating the entire taxonomy snapshot.

## Context

The original taxonomy system required submitting a complete JSON snapshot of the entire organizational taxonomy to make any change. Adding a single environment or renaming a capability meant regenerating and re-ingesting the full hierarchy. This was slow, error-prone, and didn't support incremental updates from CI/CD pipelines or UI forms. The taxonomy API now supports granular CRUD operations for all 8 entity types (nodes, environments, layer types, capabilities, capability relationships, actions, stages, and tools), with referential integrity validation to prevent orphaned relationships. The full-snapshot ingestion endpoint remains available for initial setup and bulk imports.

## Road Items

- **ROAD-041** (Taxonomy CRUD Operations) -- Primary implementation road item

## Acceptance Criteria

1. CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) are available for all 8 taxonomy entity types: nodes, environments, layer types, capabilities, capability relationships, actions, stages, and tools
2. Referential integrity is validated on create, update, and delete — preventing orphaned children, dangling capability references, and invalid parent IDs
3. Backward compatibility is maintained with full-snapshot taxonomy ingestion for bulk setup and migration
