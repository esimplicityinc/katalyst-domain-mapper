# US-057: Persist FOE Project Selection Across Refresh

**As an** Engineering Team Lead,
**I want to** have my selected FOE project remembered across page refreshes,
**so that** I don't lose my place when the browser reloads or I navigate away and return.

## Context

After the multi-project browser was introduced (US-056), users reported that selecting a project and then refreshing the page dropped them back to the project list instead of staying on the selected project's report. This was a regression from the simpler single-upload model where the report was always in view. Storing the selected project ID in localStorage provides seamless persistence without requiring a backend session.

## Road Items

- **ROAD-030** (FOE Multi-Project Browser) -- Primary implementation road item

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Selected project ID is stored in localStorage when a project is selected
2. On page reload, the previously selected project is automatically re-selected and its report displayed
3. If the stored project ID references a project that has been deleted, the app gracefully falls back to the project list view
4. Selection entry is cleared from localStorage when a project is explicitly deleted by the user
