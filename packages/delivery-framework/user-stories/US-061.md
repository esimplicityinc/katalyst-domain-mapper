# US-061: View System Taxonomy in Strategy Section

**As a** Platform Engineer,
**I want to** view the system taxonomy within the Strategy section of the documentation,
**so that** I can understand organizational structure, system hierarchy, capabilities, environments, and dependencies from a strategic perspective.

## Context

The Taxonomy feature (CAP-013) provides a structured view of an organization's technical landscape — from top-level org units down to individual system components, their capabilities, environments, and dependencies. Previously, taxonomy data had no dedicated UI home. With the lifecycle navigation redesign (ROAD-040), Taxonomy has been placed under the Strategy stage, where it naturally belongs: understanding your system landscape is a strategic activity that informs all downstream delivery decisions. Five dedicated pages cover the key taxonomy dimensions.

## Road Items

- **ROAD-040** (Lifecycle Navigation Redesign) -- Primary implementation road item

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Five taxonomy pages are available: Organization Structure, System Hierarchy, Capability Mapping, Environments, and Dependency Graph
2. All taxonomy pages are linked from the Strategy lifecycle stage in the sidebar navigation
3. Taxonomy content is searchable within each page (filter nodes, capabilities, environments by name)
