# US-038: Export Domain Model as Markdown Documentation

**As an** Engineering Team Lead,
**I want to** export the entire domain model as a set of markdown files,
**so that** the domain documentation lives alongside the code and is version-controlled.

## Context

Domain knowledge captured in the Katalyst API should be exportable as git-friendly markdown files. This enables teams to commit domain documentation alongside their code, review it in pull requests, and keep it version-controlled. The export format matches the quality of hand-written DDD documentation (like the OPR project's `docs/domain/` directory).

## Road Items

- **ROAD-021** (Markdown Documentation Export)

## Acceptance Criteria

1. "Export as Markdown" button in the domain mapper UI triggers a download
2. Download is a `.zip` file containing 6 markdown files
3. `glossary.md` lists all terms alphabetically with definitions, aliases, and context associations
4. `subdomains.md` shows a classification table and strategic implications per subdomain type
5. `context-map.md` includes ASCII art diagram and relationship descriptions with DDD patterns
6. `bounded-contexts.md` describes each context with responsibility, team ownership, and related artifacts
7. `aggregates.md` shows aggregate structure trees with entities, value objects, invariants, and commands
8. `domain-events.md` catalogs events with trigger, effect, timing, payload fields, and consumer contexts
9. All markdown is valid CommonMark with proper heading hierarchy
10. Files include a header noting they were generated by Katalyst Domain Mapper
