# US-044: View DDD Terminology Explanations in Context

**As a** Non-Technical Stakeholder,
**I want to** see plain-English explanations of DDD terminology when I hover over info icons next to unfamiliar terms,
**so that** I can understand the Domain Mapper's output without needing prior knowledge of Domain-Driven Design.

## Context

The Domain Mapper UI uses DDD terminology throughout — "Bounded Context", "Aggregate Root", "Anti-Corruption Layer", "Ubiquitous Language", etc. These terms are precise and valuable to DDD practitioners, but opaque to stakeholders, new team members, and anyone unfamiliar with Evans' blue book. Contextual tooltips bridge this gap without dumbing down the interface: experts ignore them, newcomers learn from them.

This complements the ROAD-023 onboarding experience by providing in-situ education rather than requiring users to read a separate guide. The info icon (ℹ️) pattern is widely understood and unobtrusive.

## Road Items

- **ROAD-028** (DDD Terminology Explainer Tooltips) -- Primary implementation road item

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A small ℹ️ info icon appears next to DDD terminology across all Domain Mapper views
2. Hovering the icon (desktop) shows a popover with:
   - Term name in bold
   - Plain-English definition (1-2 sentences, no jargon)
   - Optional "Learn more" link to external DDD resources
3. Tapping the icon (mobile/touch) shows the same popover
4. Tooltips cover at least 15 DDD terms including: Bounded Context, Aggregate, Entity, Value Object, Domain Event, Ubiquitous Language, Context Map, Upstream/Downstream, Anti-Corruption Layer, Customer-Supplier, Conformist, Shared Kernel, Core Domain, Supporting Subdomain, Generic Subdomain, Invariant, Command, Root Entity
5. Tooltips appear in all DDD views: Context Map, Aggregates, Events, Workflows, Glossary
6. Tooltips render correctly in dark mode with appropriate contrast
7. Tooltips are dismissable — clicking elsewhere or pressing Escape closes them
8. Tooltips do not obscure interactive elements or block click/tap targets
9. A "Hide DDD tips" toggle is available (persisted in localStorage) for experienced users
10. Tooltip content is maintained as a static dictionary (easy to update without code changes)
