# US-033: Visualize Context Map as Interactive SVG Diagram

**As a** Domain Architect,
**I want to** see bounded contexts as an interactive SVG diagram with relationship arrows and DDD pattern labels,
**so that** I can understand the system's topology, identify coupling patterns, and communicate the architecture to stakeholders at a glance.

## Context

The existing context map view (US-029) renders bounded contexts as expandable list cards. This story adds a rich SVG-based diagram view — similar to the OPR domain documentation site — that shows the spatial relationships between contexts with arrows, labels, and interactive highlighting. The diagram consumes data from the DDD Domain Modeling API (CAP-009) and uses subdomain classification (CAP-011) for color coding.

## Differentiation from US-029

US-029 covers the card-based list view of bounded contexts with expand-to-see-aggregates. US-033 adds an interactive SVG diagram showing spatial layout, relationship paths with DDD pattern labels, and hover/click interactivity. Both views coexist — users can switch between list and diagram views.

## Road Items

- **ROAD-016** (Interactive Context Map Diagram)

## Acceptance Criteria

1. SVG canvas renders all bounded contexts as positioned, colored nodes
2. Nodes are color-coded by subdomain type (Core=blue, Supporting=green, Generic=gray)
3. Curved SVG paths connect related contexts with arrowheads
4. Relationship pattern labels (Customer-Supplier, Conformist, ACL, etc.) appear on paths
5. Hovering a context highlights connected paths and dims unrelated nodes
6. Clicking a context opens a detail panel with description, relationships, and artifact counts
7. External systems render as distinct visual elements (darker color, ACL dashed lines)
8. Canvas is responsive and works from 320px to 1920px
9. Dark mode supported with appropriate color adjustments
10. Keyboard navigation: Tab between nodes, Enter to select, Escape to deselect
