# US-048: Track Maturity Level Progression

**As an** Engineering Team Lead,
**I want to** view a timeline of our maturity level progression,
**so that** I can celebrate milestones and understand how long it takes to advance between stages.

## Context

Maturity levels are milestone achievements:
- **Hypothesized** (0-39) - Exploring FOE concepts
- **Emerging** (40-59) - Beginning to adopt practices
- **Practicing** (60-79) - Consistently applying FOE
- **Optimized** (80-100) - Advanced, refined implementation

Visualizing these transitions helps teams:
- Celebrate achievements (moving to Practicing!)
- Set realistic expectations (Emerging → Practicing took 6 months)
- Identify plateaus (stuck at Emerging for 3 scans)
- Present progress to leadership

## Road Items

- **ROAD-042** (FOE Report Trend Visualization) — Implements this story

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Timeline Component**: Horizontal timeline with 4 stages displayed
2. **Scan Points**: Each scan appears as a dot on the timeline at its maturity level
3. **Date Labels**: Scan date shown below each dot
4. **Score Labels**: Overall score shown above each dot
5. **Stage Transitions**: Arrows or lines connecting scans to show progression
6. **Color Coding**:
   - Hypothesized: Gray
   - Emerging: Yellow/Amber
   - Practicing: Blue
   - Optimized: Green
7. **Interactive**: Clicking a scan dot opens that report in a modal or navigates to detail page
8. **Duration Stats**: Shows "Days at this level" between transitions
9. **Responsive**: Works on mobile (vertical timeline) and desktop (horizontal)
10. **Empty State**: Friendly message if only 1 scan exists ("Run another scan to see progression")

## Technical Details

### Data Transformation
```typescript
const maturityHistory = reports.map(report => ({
  scanDate: report.scanDate,
  maturityLevel: report.maturityLevel,
  overallScore: report.overallScore,
  scanId: report.id
}));

// Group by maturity level to calculate duration
const stageStats = calculateStageDurations(maturityHistory);
```

### Component Structure
```tsx
<MaturityTimeline>
  <TimelineHeader stages={['Hypothesized', 'Emerging', 'Practicing', 'Optimized']} />
  <TimelineTrack>
    {maturityHistory.map(scan => (
      <ScanPoint
        key={scan.scanId}
        maturity={scan.maturityLevel}
        score={scan.overallScore}
        date={scan.scanDate}
        onClick={() => navigateToReport(scan.scanId)}
      />
    ))}
  </TimelineTrack>
  <StageDurations stats={stageStats} />
</MaturityTimeline>
```

### Styling (Tailwind)
```tsx
const maturityColors = {
  Hypothesized: 'bg-gray-400',
  Emerging: 'bg-yellow-400',
  Practicing: 'bg-blue-500',
  Optimized: 'bg-green-500'
};
```
