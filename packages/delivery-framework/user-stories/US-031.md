# US-031: Filter and Paginate Report Listings

**As an** Engineering Team Lead,
**I want to** filter and paginate the report listing endpoint,
**so that** I can find specific reports by repository, maturity level, or score range without loading everything.

## Context

As scan history grows, the full report list becomes unwieldy. Filtering by repository, maturity level, and score range allows the team lead to focus on specific assessments. Pagination enables efficient loading in the dashboard UI.

## Road Items

- **ROAD-001** (Import Governance Infrastructure) -- Report listing enhancements

## Acceptance Criteria

1. `?repositoryId=<uuid>` filters to reports for that repository only
2. `?maturityLevel=Practicing` filters to that maturity level
3. `?minScore=60&maxScore=80` filters to reports within the score range
4. `?limit=5&offset=10` paginates results
5. Combining filters works correctly (AND logic)
6. No results returns `[]` with status 200
