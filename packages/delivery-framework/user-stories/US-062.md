# US-062: Access FOE Scanner from Strategy Lifecycle Stage

**As an** Engineering Team Lead,
**I want to** access the FOE Scanner from the Strategy section of the lifecycle navigation,
**so that** I can find FOE scanning tools in the context where strategic assessment naturally belongs.

## Context

The FOE Scanner was originally located at a standalone `/reports` route with no clear connection to the broader delivery lifecycle. With the lifecycle navigation redesign (ROAD-040), the scanner has been relocated to `/strategy/foe-scanner` under the Strategy stage. This placement reflects that FOE assessment is a strategic activity — understanding where your engineering practices stand and where to invest. The legacy `/reports` URL continues to work via a redirect to prevent broken bookmarks and shared links.

## Road Items

- **ROAD-040** (Lifecycle Navigation Redesign) -- Primary implementation road item

## Acceptance Criteria

1. FOE scanner is accessible via Strategy > FOE Scanner in the sidebar navigation
2. Legacy `/reports` URL redirects to `/strategy/foe-scanner` for backward compatibility
3. Strategy landing page includes a FOE Scanner card with a brief description and direct link to the scanner
