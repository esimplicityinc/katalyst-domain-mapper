# US-008: Validate Governance Before Commit

**As an** AI Agent,
**I want to** validate governance artifacts before committing changes,
**so that** I never introduce invalid frontmatter or broken cross-references into the repository.

## Context

AI agents create and modify governance artifacts (ROAD items, ADRs, change entries) as part of their workflow. Before committing, they need to validate that all frontmatter is schema-compliant and all cross-references resolve correctly. This prevents corrupt data from entering the governance system.

## Road Items

- **ROAD-004** (Parsers, Builder & CLI) -- Provides the `validate:governance` CLI command

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Agent can run `foe-field-guide validate:governance` from the CLI
2. Validation checks all frontmatter against Zod schemas
3. Cross-reference errors are reported with file path and field name
4. Exit code 1 on any validation failure prevents commit
5. Validation can target a specific file path for incremental checks
6. Output is parseable for agent consumption (structured error messages)
