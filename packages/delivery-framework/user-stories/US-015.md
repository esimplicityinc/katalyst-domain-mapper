# US-015: Integrate Governance Validation in CI

**As a** Framework Adopter,
**I want to** add governance validation to my CI/CD pipeline,
**so that** broken governance artifacts are caught before merge and the governance index is always up to date.

## Context

Once the framework is adopted, governance validation should run automatically in CI alongside tests and linting. This ensures that all governance artifacts remain schema-compliant, cross-references are intact, and state machine rules are followed.

## Road Items

- **ROAD-004** (Parsers & CLI) -- Provides CLI commands for CI
- **ROAD-008** (Framework Integration) -- Validates the CI integration pathway

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Adopter can add `foe-field-guide validate:governance` to their CI pipeline
2. CI fails if any governance artifact has invalid frontmatter
3. CI fails if referential integrity checks find broken cross-references
4. CI fails if ROAD item state machine transitions are invalid
5. `build:governance` produces `governance-index.json` as a CI artifact
6. `coverage:capabilities` and `coverage:personas` can run as CI reporting steps
7. CI completes in under 30 seconds for governance validation
