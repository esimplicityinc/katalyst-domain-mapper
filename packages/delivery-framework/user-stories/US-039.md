# US-039: Generate Standalone Static Documentation Site

**As a** Framework Adopter,
**I want to** generate a standalone React site from my domain model,
**so that** I can deploy it as a self-contained documentation site that anyone can browse without needing the Katalyst backend.

## Context

Some teams want to share domain knowledge broadly — with stakeholders, contractors, or other teams — without requiring access to the Katalyst web UI or API. This story generates a complete, deployable static site (like the OPR domain documentation site) pre-populated with the team's domain model data.

## Road Items

- **ROAD-022** (Static Documentation Site Generator)

## Acceptance Criteria

1. "Generate Site" button in the domain mapper UI triggers site generation
2. Output is a downloadable `.zip` containing a complete Vite + React + Tailwind project
3. Running `npm install && npm run build` in the unzipped project produces a deployable `dist/` directory
4. Site includes 5 sections: Overview, Contexts (interactive diagram), Aggregates (tree), Events (flow), Glossary (searchable)
5. Site includes a "How It Was Generated" page explaining the Domain Mapper workflow
6. Domain model data is embedded as JSON imports (no runtime API calls)
7. Site is responsive (mobile, tablet, desktop)
8. Site supports dark mode (respects system preference)
9. Total build output is under 5MB
10. Site renders correctly when served from any static host
