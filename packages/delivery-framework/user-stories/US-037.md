# US-037: Classify Bounded Contexts by Subdomain Type

**As a** Platform Engineer,
**I want to** classify each bounded context as Core, Supporting, or Generic,
**so that** I can make informed decisions about where to invest development effort, what to build vs buy, and how to align team structure.

## Context

DDD subdomain classification is a strategic tool that helps teams prioritize. Core subdomains deserve the most investment and the best engineers. Supporting subdomains are essential but not differentiating. Generic subdomains are commodity concerns that should be bought or minimally built. This classification drives color coding in visualizations (CAP-010) and informs the investment guidance shown in the UI.

## API Extension Required

Add `subdomainType` field to the bounded context model in CAP-009. Acceptable values: `core`, `supporting`, `generic`. Default: `null` (unclassified).

## Road Items

- **ROAD-020** (Subdomain Classification System)

## Acceptance Criteria

1. `subdomainType` field added to bounded context API model (core/supporting/generic/null)
2. Context creation form has a dropdown for subdomain type selection
3. Context edit supports changing the subdomain type
4. Classification overview card shows contexts grouped by type with counts
5. Context list shows color-coded subdomain badge next to each context title
6. Context map diagram (US-033) uses subdomain type for node color
7. Investment level indicator: Core=High, Supporting=Medium, Generic=Low
8. Build-vs-buy hint: Core=Build, Supporting=Integrate, Generic=Buy
