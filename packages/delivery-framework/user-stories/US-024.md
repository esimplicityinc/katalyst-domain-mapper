# US-024: Import GitHub Quality Signals

**As an** Engineering Team Lead,
**I want to** import GitHub PR review quality signals into the scanner,
**so that** the Confidence dimension score reflects real code review practices and quality gate enforcement.

## Context

The current scanner assesses Confidence from test coverage and static analysis config. GitHub provides additional quality signals: PR review depth shows how thoroughly code is reviewed, branch protection rules show what quality gates are enforced, and merge policies show consistency of the development workflow. These are strong indicators of team confidence in their code.

## Road Items

- **ROAD-014** (GitHub Confidence Integration) -- Primary implementation road item

## Acceptance Criteria

1. PR review data is imported (approval rate, review depth, turnaround time)
2. Code review coverage is calculated (% of PRs with substantive reviews)
3. Review turnaround time is calculated (median time from PR open to first review)
4. Branch protection rules are assessed (required reviews, status checks, signed commits)
5. Merge policies are assessed (squash/merge/rebase strategy, linear history)
6. Imported signals feed into the scanner's Confidence dimension scoring
7. CLI command `github:import --confidence` pulls review/protection data
8. Repos without branch protection get specific gap recommendations
