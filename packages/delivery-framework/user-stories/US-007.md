# US-007: Define DDD Artifact Schemas

**As a** Platform Engineer,
**I want to** create Zod schemas for DDD domain model artifacts,
**so that** bounded contexts, aggregates, value objects, and domain events become first-class validated artifacts.

## Context

DDD knowledge is currently embedded in agent prompts. Moving it to validated markdown files with frontmatter schemas makes the domain model inspectable, cross-referenceable, and visualizable. The schemas follow the same pattern as governance schemas.

## Road Items

- **ROAD-003** (DDD Artifact Schemas) -- Primary implementation road item

## Acceptance Criteria

1. `BoundedContextSchema` validates slug, responsibility, communication pattern, upstream/downstream
2. `AggregateSchema` validates root entity, invariants, commands, events, context reference
3. `ValueObjectSchema` validates properties with types and constraints, immutability flag
4. `DomainEventSchema` validates payload fields, source aggregate, subscriber contexts
5. `GovernanceIndexSchema` extended with DDD collections and reverse indices
6. All DDD schemas export both Zod objects and inferred TypeScript types
7. Unit tests cover valid and invalid DDD artifact frontmatter
