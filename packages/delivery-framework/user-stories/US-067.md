# US-067: View Collapsible Context Groups in Event Flow

**As a** Domain Architect,
**I want to** see context groups collapsed by default in the Domain Events view,
**so that** I can focus on the bounded contexts I care about without being overwhelmed by the full event list.

## Context

The Domain Events view groups events by bounded context, which is the right organizational model. However, all context groups were expanded by default, meaning a domain model with 5+ bounded contexts and dozens of events rendered as an overwhelming wall of content. Users had to scroll extensively to find the context they cared about. Context groups are now collapsed by default, showing only the bounded context names with event counts. Clicking a group header expands it to reveal its events. This reduces cognitive load on initial page load and lets users drill into specific contexts on demand.

## Road Items

- N/A (UX improvement, no dedicated road item)

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Context groups in the Domain Events view are collapsed by default, showing only the bounded context name and event count
2. Clicking a context group header toggles expand/collapse for that group's events
3. Chevron icons (pointing right when collapsed, down when expanded) indicate the current state
4. BDD tests are updated to account for the collapsible behavior (e.g., expanding a group before asserting on its events)
