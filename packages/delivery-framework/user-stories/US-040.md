# US-040: View Domain Mapper Onboarding and Workflow Guide

**As a** Framework Adopter,
**I want to** understand how the Domain Mapper tool works — the 4-phase workflow (Intake, Discovery, Facilitation, Documentation),
**so that** I know what to expect and how to get the most value from the AI-assisted domain mapping process.

## Context

First-time users of the Domain Mapper see a chat interface but don't understand the overall workflow: how the AI discovers domain concepts, why it asks validation questions, and what artifacts it produces. An onboarding page explains the 4-phase process and sets expectations, inspired by the OPR site's "How It Works" section.

## Road Items

- **ROAD-023** (Onboarding & How It Works Experience)

## Acceptance Criteria

1. "How It Works" link appears in the sidebar navigation under Domain Mapper
2. Page shows a visual workflow with 4 phases: Intake, Discovery, Facilitation, Documentation
3. Each phase has an icon, title, and short description
4. Clicking/expanding a phase shows detailed explanation of what happens
5. "Why Human-in-the-Loop?" section explains context preservation, intent validation, boundary decisions, and language refinement
6. "Output Artifacts" section lists: glossary.md, subdomains.md, context-map.md, bounded-contexts.md, aggregates.md, domain-events.md, static site
7. Quick-start panel suggests "Start by navigating to the Chat tab and asking about your domain"
8. Page works in dark mode with appropriate contrast
9. Page is responsive (stacks on mobile, side-by-side on desktop)
