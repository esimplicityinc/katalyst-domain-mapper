# US-001: View FOE Scan Report

**As an** Engineering Team Lead,
**I want to** view a comprehensive FOE scan report for my repository,
**so that** I can understand our engineering maturity and identify specific areas for improvement.

## Context

After the scanner container produces a JSON report, the team lead needs a visual way to understand the results without reading raw JSON. The web UI provides interactive visualizations of all report dimensions.

## Road Items

- **ROAD-001** (Import Infrastructure) -- Web UI is part of the imported infrastructure
- **ROAD-009** (Web Visualization) -- Enhanced governance dashboard adds more visualization

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Team lead can upload a scan report JSON via drag-and-drop
2. Cognitive triangle diagram renders with safe zone indicators
3. Three dimension scores display with radial charts and expandable subscores
4. Top 3 strengths and top 3 gaps are listed with severity and evidence
5. Maturity level (Hypothesized/Emerging/Practicing/Optimized) is clearly displayed
6. Recommendations link to specific Field Guide methods
