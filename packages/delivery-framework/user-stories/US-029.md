# US-029: View DDD Domain Model in Context Map UI

**As an** Engineering Team Lead,
**I want to** view the DDD domain model in an interactive context map,
**so that** I can understand system boundaries, team ownership, and inter-context relationships at a glance.

## Context

The DDD context map UI consumes data from the domain-models API (CAP-009) and renders it as an interactive visualization. This is the primary way non-technical stakeholders understand the system's domain architecture.

## Road Items

- **ROAD-009** (Governance & DDD Web Visualization) -- Context map template

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Context map page loads bounded contexts from `GET /api/v1/domain-models/:id`
2. Each context card displays title, responsibility, and team ownership
3. Upstream/downstream relationships are visualized as directional connections
4. Clicking a context expands to show aggregates and events
5. Glossary terms are searchable from the context map view
