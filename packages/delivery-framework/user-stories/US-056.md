# US-056: Browse FOE Projects in Multi-Project List

**As an** Engineering Team Lead,
**I want to** browse all my FOE scanned projects in a multi-project list view,
**so that** I can quickly find and compare projects without re-uploading reports each time.

## Context

The original FOE Reports experience was a one-shot workflow: upload a JSON file, view the report, lose it on navigation. This worked for single-report review but fell apart when teams needed to track multiple projects over time. The FOE Reports page has been redesigned as a multi-project browser — similar to the Domain Mapper's model list — where each project persists and can be revisited at any time. This transforms FOE Reports from a throwaway viewer into a persistent project dashboard.

## Road Items

- **ROAD-030** (FOE Multi-Project Browser) -- Primary implementation road item

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Project list displays each project with name, scan date, overall score, and maturity level
2. Users can search and filter projects by name using a text input
3. Projects are sortable by date, score, or name (ascending/descending)
4. Empty state shows a clear call-to-action to upload the first scan report
5. Project list renders as a responsive grid (cards on desktop, stacked on mobile)
6. All list elements render correctly in dark mode with appropriate contrast
