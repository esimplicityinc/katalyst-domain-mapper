# US-014: Import Framework Into New Project

**As a** Framework Adopter,
**I want to** import the Katalyst Delivery Framework into my own project,
**so that** I get a ready-made governance infrastructure without building it from scratch.

## Context

The delivery framework is designed to be generic and importable. Adopters copy the package into their monorepo, customize branding, and start creating their own governance artifacts. The framework should work out of the box with zero artifacts and progressively become more useful as content is added.

## Road Items

- **ROAD-001** (Import Infrastructure) -- The framework must be set up first
- **ROAD-008** (Framework Integration) -- Validates the adoption pathway

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Adopter can copy or install the delivery-framework package into their monorepo
2. Docusaurus site starts with customizable branding (title, logo, colors)
3. All governance templates (ROAD, ADR, NFR, CHANGE) are available and customizable
4. DDD doc templates provide empty scaffolding for the adopter's domain
5. Governance scripts run out of the box with zero artifacts (graceful empty state)
6. README or getting-started guide walks through the import process
7. Adopter can create their first ROAD item using the template and see it on the dashboard
