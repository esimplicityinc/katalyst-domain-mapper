# US-022: Import GitHub Docs for Scanning

**As an** Engineering Team Lead,
**I want to** import GitHub documentation signals (PRs, commits, wiki, docs) into the scanner,
**so that** the Understanding dimension score reflects real documentation quality and team communication practices.

## Context

The current scanner assesses Understanding from in-repo documentation. GitHub provides additional signals: PR description quality shows how well changes are communicated, commit messages show naming conventions, wiki pages provide supplementary documentation, and Discussions capture team knowledge. Importing these enriches the Understanding assessment.

## Road Items

- **ROAD-013** (GitHub Understanding Integration) -- Primary implementation road item

## Acceptance Criteria

1. PR descriptions are imported and assessed for quality (length, context, linked issues)
2. Commit message quality is assessed (Conventional Commits compliance, linked issues, clarity)
3. Documentation presence is checked (README, CONTRIBUTING, CHANGELOG, ADRs, wiki pages)
4. Wiki pages are imported and assessed for documentation coverage and freshness
5. GitHub Discussions are imported as knowledge artifacts
6. Imported content feeds into the scanner's Understanding dimension scoring
7. CLI command `github:import --understanding` pulls docs/PR data
8. Missing documentation results in specific gap recommendations
