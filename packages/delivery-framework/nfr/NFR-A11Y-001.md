# NFR-A11Y-001: WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance for Web UIs

## Requirement

All web interfaces in the project (foe-web-ui, web-report, delivery-framework Docusaurus site) must meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards. This includes keyboard navigation, screen reader support, sufficient color contrast, focus management, and semantic HTML.

## Rationale

The web UIs are used by:
1. **Engineering team leads** (PER-001) reviewing FOE reports and governance dashboards
2. **Platform engineers** (PER-002) configuring scans and monitoring pipeline health
3. **Documentation authors** (PER-004) editing governance artifacts via the Docusaurus site
4. **Framework adopters** (PER-005) evaluating the delivery framework

Accessibility ensures all users, including those using assistive technologies, can effectively use the system. WCAG 2.1 AA is the industry standard and a common procurement requirement for enterprise tooling.

## Acceptance Criteria

| Metric | Target | Measurement Method |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| axe-core critical violations | 0 | Automated axe-core scan of all pages |
| axe-core serious violations | 0 | Automated axe-core scan of all pages |
| Color contrast ratio (normal text) | >= 4.5:1 | Automated contrast checker |
| Color contrast ratio (large text) | >= 3:1 | Automated contrast checker |
| Keyboard navigability | All interactive elements reachable | Manual keyboard-only testing |
| Focus indicators | Visible on all focusable elements | Manual visual inspection |
| Screen reader compatibility | Meaningful announcements | Manual testing with VoiceOver/NVDA |
| Image alt text | All images have descriptive alt text | Automated check |
| Form labels | All inputs have associated labels | Automated axe-core check |
| ARIA landmarks | Main, navigation, complementary present | Automated check |
| Dark mode contrast | Meets same contrast ratios in dark mode | Automated check in dark mode |
| SVG diagrams (context maps, triangles) | ARIA labels + text fallback | Manual + automated check |

## Test Strategy

### How to Validate

1. Run axe-core automated accessibility scan on every page of each web UI:
   - foe-web-ui: Report upload, report viewer, dimension cards, triangle diagram, governance dashboard
   - web-report: All 11 report templates
   - delivery-framework: Roadmap dashboard, BDD viewer, Kanban board, DDD context map
2. Perform manual keyboard navigation test:
   - Tab through all interactive elements (buttons, links, dropdowns, expandable sections)
   - Verify focus order is logical
   - Verify focus indicators are visible
3. Test with screen reader (VoiceOver on macOS):
   - Verify page landmarks are announced
   - Verify chart data has text alternatives
   - Verify SVG diagrams have ARIA labels
4. Check both light and dark mode for contrast compliance
5. Verify responsive design at 320px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px viewports
