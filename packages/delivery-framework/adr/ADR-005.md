# ADR-005: Docusaurus as Governance Documentation Platform

## Status

**Accepted** - 2026-02-06

## Context

The delivery framework needs a documentation platform that:

1. Renders markdown files (governance artifacts, DDD docs, BDD features, plans) as a browsable site
2. Supports custom React components (roadmap dashboards, Kanban boards, BDD viewers, context maps)
3. Has a plugin system for loading custom data (roadmap JSON, BDD feature data)
4. Supports Mermaid diagrams for architecture and workflow visualization
5. Generates a static site deployable anywhere (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, Nginx)
6. Provides sidebar navigation, search, and versioning

The documentation site is the **primary interface** for governance artifacts -- capabilities, personas, user stories, ROAD items, ADRs, NFRs, and change entries are all markdown files rendered through this platform.

## Decision

Use **Docusaurus 3.9.2** as the documentation platform for `packages/delivery-framework/`.

Key aspects:
- Markdown docs with YAML frontmatter rendered as pages
- Custom data plugins (`roadmap-data-plugin.js`, `bdd-data-plugin.js`) load structured data from static JSON files
- 16 custom React components for governance visualization (dashboards, Kanban, timelines, BDD viewers)
- Mermaid plugin for inline architecture diagrams
- `@xyflow/react` for interactive context map visualization
- Sidebar configuration in `sidebars.ts` with auto-generated navigation from directory structure

## Consequences

### Positive

- Markdown-first authoring: governance artifacts are plain files that can be edited by humans or AI agents
- Rich React component support enables interactive dashboards within the documentation
- Static site output: zero server requirements for hosting
- Plugin system allows governance data to be pre-processed at build time
- Built-in search, versioning, and i18n support
- Active open-source community and Meta backing

### Negative

- Node.js dependency for the build process (separate from Bun runtime used by other packages)
- Docusaurus has opinions about directory structure and URL routing
- Custom plugins require understanding Docusaurus's data lifecycle
- Hot reload can be slow with many custom components and data plugins

### Neutral

- The delivery-framework package has its own `package.json` with Docusaurus-specific dependencies
- Build output goes to `build/` directory as static HTML/CSS/JS
- MDX support allows embedding React components directly in markdown files

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: VitePress

**Description**: Vue-based static documentation generator by the Vue.js team.

**Pros**:
- Very fast build times (Vite-based)
- Clean, modern default theme
- Lighter weight than Docusaurus

**Cons**:
- Vue-based components (project uses React everywhere else)
- Less mature plugin system
- Fewer built-in features (no versioning, limited search)

**Why Rejected**: Using Vue components in a React project creates toolchain inconsistency. The project's existing React components (16 governance components) would need to be rewritten.

### Alternative 2: Astro Starlight

**Description**: Astro-based documentation framework with multi-framework component support.

**Pros**:
- Framework-agnostic (supports React, Vue, Svelte)
- Fast builds with partial hydration
- Modern architecture

**Cons**:
- Newer ecosystem, fewer plugins
- Custom data plugin patterns are less documented
- Smaller community for governance-style documentation

**Why Rejected**: Less mature ecosystem and fewer examples for the complex data plugin patterns the governance framework requires.

### Alternative 3: Custom Next.js Site

**Description**: Build a custom documentation site using Next.js with MDX support.

**Pros**:
- Full control over every aspect
- Already using Next.js for `@foe/web-report`
- Can share components between packages

**Cons**:
- Significant development effort to replicate Docusaurus features (sidebar, search, navigation)
- No built-in documentation conventions
- Maintenance burden for features Docusaurus provides out of the box

**Why Rejected**: Building documentation infrastructure from scratch is not a core capability of the project. Docusaurus provides these features for free.

## Implementation Notes

- Docusaurus config in `docusaurus.config.ts` with Katalyst branding
- Sidebars auto-generated from directory structure with manual ordering overrides
- Data plugins read from `static/roadmap-data.json` and `static/bdd-data.json`
- React components in `src/components/` with CSS modules for styling
- Build command: `bun run build` (delegates to `docusaurus build`)
- Dev server: `bun run start` (delegates to `docusaurus start`)

## Compliance

This ADR affects the following areas:
- **Road Items**: ROAD-001, ROAD-008
- **NFRs**: NFR-A11Y-001 (WCAG compliance for the docs site)
- **BDD Scenarios**: UI feature files for documentation rendering
