# ADR-011: DomainModel as Canonical Term for Domain Aggregation

## Status

**Accepted** - 2026-02-09

## Context

During the ROAD-001 import of the delivery framework, a `DomainLandscape` duplicate was discovered alongside the existing `DomainModel`. Both had identical Zod schemas — the same shape with `boundedContexts`, `aggregates`, `valueObjects`, `domainEvents`, and `glossary` arrays under a top-level container with `id`, `name`, `description`, and timestamps.

Investigation revealed a stark asymmetry:

- **DomainModel** is used in 32 files across all layers: database schema, API routes, Web UI components, tests, documentation, and agent prompts. It is the established term in the codebase.
- **DomainLandscape** appears in only 2 orphan files: an unexported schema file (`packages/foe-schemas/src/ddd/domain-landscape.ts`) and a broken route file (`packages/foe-api/src/http/routes/v1/domain-landscapes.ts`) that references nonexistent DB tables (`schema.domainLandscapes`). Neither file is imported, registered, or tested anywhere.

The duplication creates naming confusion and violates the DDD principle of ubiquitous language — a single concept should have a single name throughout the system.

## Decision

`DomainModel` is the canonical term for the top-level container that aggregates bounded contexts, aggregates, value objects, domain events, and glossary terms for a project.

The two `DomainLandscape` files are deleted as dead code:

1. `packages/foe-schemas/src/ddd/domain-landscape.ts` — unexported schema, never imported
2. `packages/foe-api/src/http/routes/v1/domain-landscapes.ts` — broken routes referencing nonexistent DB tables, never registered in the server

If a cross-model overview concept is needed in the future (e.g., viewing multiple domain models together), it should be modeled as a distinct concept (e.g., `DomainLandscapeView`) rather than duplicating `DomainModel`.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Eliminates naming confusion between `DomainModel` and `DomainLandscape`
- Removes 2 dead files (~344 lines of unreachable code)
- Establishes clear ubiquitous language: one concept, one name
- Aligns with standard DDD terminology where "domain model" is the recognized term

### Negative

- None — `DomainLandscape` was never functional. No code, tests, or users depend on it.

### Neutral

- The term "landscape" could still be used informally in documentation or conversation to describe a high-level view of multiple domain models
- If a `DomainLandscapeView` concept is introduced later, it would be a genuinely distinct concept with its own schema

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Keep Both with Distinct Semantics

**Description**: Differentiate `DomainModel` (detailed artifact container) from `DomainLandscape` (high-level overview).

**Pros**:
- Two terms for two perspectives on domain knowledge
- Preserves existing code without deletion

**Cons**:
- The schemas were identical — there was no semantic distinction
- `DomainLandscape` was broken (nonexistent DB tables, no server registration)
- Maintaining two identical concepts violates DDD ubiquitous language

**Why Rejected**: The two schemas were identical, and `DomainLandscape` was non-functional. Creating a semantic distinction would be retroactive rationalization, not genuine design.

### Alternative 2: Rename DomainModel to DomainLandscape

**Description**: Adopt `DomainLandscape` as the canonical term instead.

**Pros**:
- "Landscape" implies a broader, more visual concept

**Cons**:
- `DomainModel` has 32-file adoption across all layers (DB, API, UI, tests, docs, agents)
- "Domain model" is the standard DDD vocabulary term
- Renaming would require changes across the entire codebase
- Risk of introducing bugs during a mass rename

**Why Rejected**: `DomainModel` has overwhelming adoption and aligns with standard DDD terminology. Renaming would be high-effort, high-risk, and linguistically inferior.

## Implementation Notes

- Deleted `packages/foe-schemas/src/ddd/domain-landscape.ts` (25 lines — unexported Zod schema)
- Deleted `packages/foe-api/src/http/routes/v1/domain-landscapes.ts` (319 lines — broken CRUD routes)
- No database migration needed — `DomainLandscape` was never connected to any DB tables
- No server changes needed — the route file was never registered in the Elysia server
- No UI changes needed — no component ever referenced `DomainLandscape`
- No test changes needed — no test ever imported or exercised `DomainLandscape`
