# ADR-017: Sequential Numbering for Retroactive Governance Artifacts

## Status

**Accepted** - 2026-02-19

## Context

This artifact was created retroactively to document work completed on 2026-02-19.

Significant development work was completed between February 10-19, 2026 without corresponding governance documentation. Features were designed, built, tested, and deployed — but the associated user stories, capabilities, ADRs, and CHANGE entries were not created contemporaneously. This created a **documentation debt** that needed to be addressed systematically.

The question arose: how should retroactive artifacts be numbered? The numbering scheme affects parsers, index builders, cross-references, and future tooling.

### Problems with Previous Approach

1. **No established convention**: The project had no precedent for creating governance artifacts after-the-fact
2. **Cross-reference fragility**: Existing artifacts reference each other by ID — any special numbering scheme could break tooling expectations
3. **Ambiguous provenance**: Without a convention, it would be unclear which artifacts were proactive vs retroactive

### Alternatives Considered

**Option 1: Sequential numbering from last existing artifact ID** (US-056+, CAP-016+, ADR-014+, CHANGE-031+)
- Pros: Simple, consistent, no tooling changes
- Cons: No visual distinction between proactive and retroactive

**Option 2: Reserved "retroactive batch" range** (US-900+, CAP-900+, ADR-900+)
- Pros: Immediately obvious which artifacts are retroactive
- Cons: Wastes ID space, requires special-case parsing logic, creates a "second class" tier of artifacts, gaps in numbering confuse automated tooling

**Option 3: Date-prefixed IDs** (US-2026-02-001+, CAP-2026-02-001+)
- Pros: Self-documenting creation period, globally unique
- Cons: Breaks existing ID format (all parsers expect `{PREFIX}-{NUMBER}`), longer IDs, inconsistent with existing artifacts, requires parser rewrites

## Decision

Use **sequential numbering from the highest existing artifact ID**. Retroactive artifacts are treated identically to proactively-created ones. Artifacts documenting already-completed work use `status: complete` to indicate they describe features that have been built.

### Implementation Details

#### Numbering Continuity

| Artifact Type | Last Existing ID | Retroactive Range |
|---------------|------------------|-------------------|
| User Stories | US-055 | US-056+ |
| Capabilities | CAP-015 | CAP-016+ |
| ADRs | ADR-013 | ADR-014+ |
| CHANGE Entries | CHANGE-030 | CHANGE-031+ |

#### Retroactive Indicator Convention

Every retroactive artifact includes a note in its **Context** section:

> "This artifact was created retroactively to document work completed on [date]."

This provides provenance information without polluting the ID scheme or requiring tooling changes.

#### Status Convention

Retroactive artifacts use appropriate status values:
- **User Stories**: `status: complete` — the feature is already built and working
- **Capabilities**: `status: complete` — the capability is already implemented
- **ADRs**: `status: accepted` — the decision was already made and implemented
- **CHANGE Entries**: Standard format — changes already recorded in the codebase

#### Rationale for Sequential Over Special Ranges

1. **Simpler for consumers**: No special-case parsing logic — `ADR-014` parses the same as `ADR-013`
2. **Treats documentation debt as normal work**: Retroactive docs are first-class artifacts, not second-class citizens
3. **Artifact IDs remain stable**: No renumbering risk, no ID collisions, no reserved ranges to manage
4. **Consistent with existing governance tooling**: Parsers, index builders, CLI tools, and cross-reference validators all work without modification
5. **No wasted ID space**: Sequential numbering uses every ID, unlike reserved ranges that create gaps

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Simplicity**: Zero tooling changes required — existing parsers, index builders, and validators work unchanged
2. **Consistency**: All artifacts follow the same numbering convention regardless of when they were documented
3. **First-class treatment**: Retroactive artifacts are indistinguishable from proactive ones in tooling and indexes
4. **Documentation debt normalization**: Establishes that creating governance artifacts after-the-fact is acceptable and expected when needed
5. **Stable cross-references**: Other artifacts can reference retroactive IDs using the same `{PREFIX}-{NUMBER}` pattern

### Negative

1. **No visual indicator in ID**: Cannot tell from the ID alone whether `ADR-014` was created proactively or retroactively — must read the Context section
2. **Potential for confusion in chronology**: `US-056` (created 2026-02-19, documents work from 2026-02-12) may appear to be newer work than `US-055` (created 2026-02-10) — mitigated by the `created` frontmatter field reflecting the documentation date, not the implementation date

### Risks

1. **Retroactive artifacts becoming the norm**: If documentation debt is too easy to address retroactively, teams may defer documentation habitually — mitigated by governance validation tooling that flags missing artifacts during development sprints
2. **Historical accuracy**: Retroactive documentation may be less accurate than real-time documentation due to memory decay — mitigated by using Git history, code comments, and PR descriptions as evidence sources
