# ADR-013: Lifecycle-Oriented Information Architecture

## Status

**Accepted** - 2026-02-16

## Context

The Katalyst Delivery Framework documentation has grown to include 11 top-level navigation items (DDD, Planning, BDD, Agents, Personas, Capabilities, Stories, Roadmap, ADRs, NFRs, Changes). While comprehensive, this flat navigation structure presents several challenges:

### Problems with Current Structure

1. **Cognitive Overload**: 11 items in the navbar exceeds the recommended 5-7 items for optimal information retention (Miller's Law)
2. **Unclear Relationships**: No visible grouping shows how artifacts relate to each other in the delivery process
3. **Poor Mental Model Alignment**: Flat structure doesn't match how software delivery teams think about their work
4. **Difficult Onboarding**: New users don't know where to start or what order to consume documentation
5. **Missing Context**: No "big picture" view of organizational and system structure (taxonomy)
6. **Non-Technical Inaccessibility**: Structure is artifact-type focused (DDD, BDD, ADR) rather than problem/workflow focused

### User Needs

**Non-Technical Software Delivery Leaders** need:
- Navigation that matches their mental model of software delivery stages
- Quick access to strategic information (roadmap, system structure)
- Visual representations of system relationships and ownership
- Reduced jargon and technical acronyms in navigation

**Technical Teams** need:
- Logical grouping of related artifacts
- Clear progression through delivery workflow
- Taxonomy documentation as source of truth for system structure
- All existing content accessible (zero loss)

**Framework Adopters** need:
- Clear onboarding path following natural progression
- Understanding of where they are in the delivery lifecycle
- Context for how governance artifacts connect to each other

## Decision

Reorganize documentation navigation into a **7-stage lifecycle-oriented information architecture** and add a comprehensive **System Taxonomy section**.

### New Navigation Structure

```
🎯 Strategy        → Roadmap, System Taxonomy
👥 Discovery       → Personas, User Stories
📋 Planning        → Implementation Plans, System Capabilities
🏗️ Design          → Domain-Driven Design, Architecture Decisions
🧪 Testing         → BDD Tests, Non-Functional Requirements
🤖 Automation      → AI Agents
📝 History         → Change Log
```

### Lifecycle Stage Definitions

| Stage | Purpose | Artifacts | Key Question |
|-------|---------|-----------|--------------|
| **Strategy** | Plan what to build | Roadmap, System Taxonomy | What should we build? Where are we going? |
| **Discovery** | Understand who/why | Personas, User Stories | Who are we building for? What do they need? |
| **Planning** | Plan how to build | Plans, Capabilities | How will we build it? What's required? |
| **Design** | Design architecture | DDD Models, ADRs | What's the architecture? How is it structured? |
| **Testing** | Validate quality | BDD Tests, NFRs | How do we validate? What are quality thresholds? |
| **Automation** | Automate delivery | AI Agents | What can be automated? How do agents help? |
| **History** | Track changes | Change Log | What have we done? What changed? |

### System Taxonomy Section (NEW)

Add comprehensive system structure documentation:
- **Organizational Structure** - Teams, departments, ownership mapping
- **System Hierarchy** - Systems → Subsystems → Stacks → Layers (FQTN)
- **Capability Mapping** - Which systems provide which capabilities
- **Environment Structure** - Dev/staging/prod configurations
- **Dependency Graph** - Visual system relationships

### Implementation Details

**Navigation UI**:
- Replace 11 flat navbar items with 7 dropdown menus
- Each dropdown contains 1-2 related sections
- Use emoji icons for visual scanning (🎯 👥 📋 🏗️ 🧪 🤖 📝)
- Maintain mobile responsive behavior (collapsible)

**Sidebar Structure**:
- Group artifacts by lifecycle stage in `sidebars.ts`
- Preserve all existing sidebar entries (zero content loss)
- Add new `taxonomySidebar` under Strategy stage

**URL Structure**:
- Keep existing URLs to preserve bookmarks
- Add redirects for legacy paths if needed
- New taxonomy URLs: `/docs/taxonomy/*`

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Reduced Cognitive Load**: 7 stages (vs 11 flat items) fits within working memory limits
2. **Natural Workflow Alignment**: Matches industry frameworks (Agile, Design Thinking, DevOps)
3. **Improved Discoverability**: Users know which stage to check based on their current activity
4. **Better Onboarding**: Clear progression from Strategy → History provides learning path
5. **Non-Technical Accessibility**: Emoji + plain language labels reduce jargon barrier
6. **Strategic Visibility**: System Taxonomy provides "big picture" organizational context
7. **Foundation for Automation**: Taxonomy enables future org chart generation, API integration
8. **Mobile Friendly**: Dropdowns work better on small screens than 11 navbar items
9. **Scalability**: Can add artifacts within stages without navbar bloat
10. **Mental Model Match**: Software delivery teams naturally think in lifecycle stages

### Negative

1. **Learning Curve**: Existing users need to adapt to new navigation (mitigated by migration guide + announcement bar)
2. **Extra Click**: Some content now requires dropdown interaction (Strategy → Roadmap vs direct Roadmap link)
3. **Implementation Effort**: 3 days to restructure sidebars, create taxonomy docs, test
4. **Redirect Maintenance**: Need to maintain URL redirects for changed paths
5. **Mobile Dropdown UX**: Dropdowns can be less discoverable on touch devices (mitigated by standard mobile menu pattern)

### Neutral

1. **Content Unchanged**: All existing documentation preserved, only navigation changes
2. **Backward Compatible**: Old URLs still work via redirects
3. **Taxonomy Hybrid Content**: Mix of hand-written guidance + auto-generated data
4. **No New Dependencies**: Pure organizational change, no new libraries

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Domain-Driven Navigation

**Description**: Group by DDD bounded contexts (Governance, Scanning, Visualization, API)

```
Governance      → ADRs, NFRs, BDD, Plans
Scanning        → FOE Scanner, Agents
Visualization   → Web UI, Context Maps
API             → DDD Models, Capabilities
```

**Pros**:
- Aligns with technical architecture
- Maps to codebase package structure
- Familiar to DDD practitioners

**Cons**:
- Too technical for non-technical leaders
- Doesn't match delivery workflow mental model
- Unclear where Personas/Stories/Roadmap fit
- Not intuitive for framework adopters

**Why Rejected**: Optimizes for DDD experts but alienates non-technical stakeholders. Bounded contexts are implementation details, not user workflows.

---

### Alternative 2: Role-Based Navigation

**Description**: Group by persona (Team Lead, Platform Engineer, AI Agent, Doc Author, Adopter)

```
Team Lead       → Roadmap, Reports, Dashboard
Platform Eng    → API, Schemas, CLI
AI Agent        → Agents, BDD, Validation
Doc Author      → DDD Docs, Templates
Adopter         → Getting Started, Import
```

**Pros**:
- Personalized experience per role
- Clear "what's relevant to me?"
- Mirrors user story grouping

**Cons**:
- Content duplication (same doc relevant to multiple roles)
- Users wear multiple hats (team leads also do platform work)
- Difficult to categorize cross-role artifacts (ADRs, NFRs)
- No natural progression/workflow
- Doesn't show how artifacts relate

**Why Rejected**: People don't think "I'm a team lead, where's my section?" They think "I'm planning a feature, where's the planning info?" Roles are identities, not workflows.

---

### Alternative 3: Alphabetical Navigation

**Description**: Keep flat structure, sort A-Z

```
ADRs, Agents, BDD, Capabilities, Changes, DDD, NFRs, Personas, Plans, Roadmap, Stories
```

**Pros**:
- Easy to find if you know the name
- No semantic grouping decisions needed
- Simple to implement

**Cons**:
- No semantic relationships shown
- Doesn't scale beyond 20 items
- No workflow guidance
- Meaningless order (why "ADRs" before "Roadmap"?)
- Still 11 items (cognitive overload remains)

**Why Rejected**: Alphabetical is an escape hatch for when you can't find meaningful organization. We can do better. Provides findability but zero discoverability.

---

### Alternative 4: Task-Based Navigation

**Description**: Group by user tasks (Plan, Build, Test, Deploy, Monitor)

```
Plan            → Roadmap, Plans, Stories
Build           → DDD, ADRs, Capabilities
Test            → BDD, NFRs
Deploy          → Agents, CI/CD
Monitor         → Changes, Dashboard
```

**Pros**:
- Action-oriented (matches "what am I doing right now?")
- Maps to DevOps lifecycle
- Clear purpose per section

**Cons**:
- Missing Discovery stage (Personas don't fit "Plan")
- "Build" is vague (design vs implementation?)
- No Strategy stage (where does Taxonomy fit?)
- DevOps-centric (assumes CI/CD maturity)

**Why Rejected**: Good attempt, but incomplete. Lacks Discovery and Strategy stages. "Build" conflates design and implementation. Lifecycle-oriented approach is more comprehensive.

---

### Alternative 5: Maturity-Based Navigation

**Description**: Group by governance maturity stage

```
Proposed        → Drafts, Proposals
Validated       → Approved ADRs, BDD
Implementing    → Active ROAD items
Complete        → Change Log
```

**Pros**:
- Shows governance workflow clearly
- Tracks artifact maturity
- Aligns with 8-state governance model

**Cons**:
- Navigation changes as artifacts progress (Roadmap moves from Proposed → Implementing → Complete)
- Users need to know maturity state to find content
- Doesn't help with "what should I work on next?"
- Temporal organization is confusing

**Why Rejected**: Maturity is useful metadata, not navigation structure. Users don't think "I need to find a validated artifact," they think "I need to understand the architecture."

---

### Alternative 6: Keep Current Structure + Add Taxonomy

**Description**: Add System Taxonomy as 12th navbar item, don't reorganize

```
DDD, Planning, BDD, Agents, Personas, Capabilities, Stories, Roadmap, ADRs, NFRs, Changes, Taxonomy (12 items)
```

**Pros**:
- Minimal implementation effort (no restructure)
- Zero user relearning required
- No risk of broken bookmarks

**Cons**:
- Makes cognitive overload worse (12 items now)
- Still no semantic grouping
- Misses opportunity to improve UX
- Doesn't solve non-technical accessibility problem
- Kicks the can down the road

**Why Rejected**: Adding Taxonomy is the trigger to fix the underlying IA problem. If we're making a change anyway, fix the root cause (poor grouping) not just the symptom (missing taxonomy).

## Why Lifecycle-Oriented Won

The lifecycle-oriented approach:

1. **Matches Industry Frameworks**:
   - **Agile/Scrum**: Backlog → Sprint → Review → Retro
   - **Design Thinking**: Empathize → Define → Ideate → Prototype → Test
   - **DevOps**: Plan → Code → Build → Test → Release → Deploy → Operate → Monitor
   - **Double Diamond**: Discover → Define → Develop → Deliver

2. **Universal Mental Model**: All software teams follow a delivery lifecycle, regardless of methodology

3. **Progressive Disclosure**: Start with Strategy (high-level), progress through stages to History (retrospective)

4. **Clear Transitions**: Natural progression answers "what's next?" (finish Testing → move to Automation)

5. **Stakeholder Inclusivity**: Non-technical leaders understand lifecycle stages without technical jargon

6. **Balanced Groupings**: 7 stages each contain 1-2 related sections (not overloaded)

7. **Scalability**: Can add artifacts within stages without navbar explosion

## Implementation Notes

### Phase 1: Create Taxonomy Documentation (Day 1)
- Create `taxonomy/` directory with 6 markdown files
- Hybrid content: hand-written guidance + auto-generated data
- Integrate with `@foe/schemas/taxonomy/taxonomy-snapshot.ts`
- Add Mermaid diagrams for system hierarchy and dependencies

### Phase 2: Restructure Navigation (Day 2)
- Update `sidebars.ts` with 7 lifecycle sidebars
- Update `docusaurus.config.ts` navbar with dropdowns
- Add `taxonomy/**` to include patterns
- Test locally: all content accessible, no 404s

### Phase 3: Migration Aids (Day 3)
- Add announcement bar: "Navigation reorganized! See migration guide"
- Create `migration-guide.md` with before/after mapping
- Configure URL redirects (if using Docusaurus redirects plugin)
- Update homepage with new navigation preview

### Validation
- Run link checker: `bun run build` (0 broken links)
- Test WCAG 2.1 AA: keyboard navigation, screen reader
- Test performance: Lighthouse audit (≥90 performance score)
- Mobile testing: iOS Safari, Android Chrome
- User testing: 2-3 non-technical users can find content faster

### Rollback Plan
- Keep backup copies of `sidebars.ts.backup`, `docusaurus.config.ts.backup`
- If issues arise, restore backups and redeploy
- Monitor analytics for 404 errors in first week

## Decision Rationale Summary

We chose **Lifecycle-Oriented Information Architecture** because:

✅ **Reduces cognitive load** (7 stages vs 11 flat items)  
✅ **Matches mental models** (industry frameworks: Agile, DevOps, Design Thinking)  
✅ **Improves discoverability** (users know which stage to check)  
✅ **Better onboarding** (clear progression from Strategy → History)  
✅ **Non-technical accessibility** (plain language + emoji icons)  
✅ **Strategic visibility** (System Taxonomy provides "big picture")  
✅ **Foundation for future** (enables automation, API integration)  
✅ **Zero content loss** (all existing docs preserved)  

The alternatives (domain-driven, role-based, alphabetical, task-based, maturity-based, status quo) failed to provide:
- Universal mental model across stakeholder types
- Natural workflow progression
- Balanced groupings without cognitive overload
- Inclusivity for non-technical users

This decision aligns with the project's goal of making governance artifacts accessible to all stakeholders, from engineering team leads to platform engineers to framework adopters.
