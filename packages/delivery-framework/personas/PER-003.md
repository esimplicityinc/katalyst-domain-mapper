description: "Creates governance artifacts, validates state machine transitions, runs BDD tests, produces scan reports, and enforces governance gates."
goals:
  - "Autonomously create valid governance artifacts (ROAD items, ADRs, CHANGE entries)"
  - "Validate artifact frontmatter and cross-references before committing"
  - "Advance ROAD items through the 8-state governance machine"
  - "Produce accurate FOE scan reports with governance dimension scoring"

  - "Lacks knowledge of project-specific BDD patterns and step definitions"
  - "Cannot validate cross-references without a built governance index"
  - "Governance validation currently requires running separate JS scripts"
behaviors:
  - "Creates ROAD items using templates and governance frontmatter"

# PER-003: AI Agent

## Overview

The AI Agent is an automated persona (OpenCode agents like `@bdd-writer`, `@code-writer`, `@change-manager`, `@architecture-inspector`) that creates, validates, and advances governance artifacts as part of the development workflow. The agent acts autonomously within defined governance boundaries.

## Key Workflows

1. **Artifact Creation** -- Creates ROAD items, ADRs, CHANGE entries with valid frontmatter using templates.
2. **Governance Validation** -- Runs `foe-field-guide validate:governance` to check frontmatter and cross-references.
3. **State Advancement** -- Checks allowed transitions before changing ROAD item status (e.g., `proposed` -> `adr_validated`).
4. **FOE Scanning** -- The scanner governance agent assesses governance maturity during repository scans.
5. **BDD Testing** -- Writes and runs BDD scenarios, updates governance BDD blocks with results.

## Interaction Pattern

Operates through the CLI and file system. Reads governance index JSON for cross-reference validation. Uses skills (katalyst-bdd-*) for framework-specific knowledge. Reports findings as structured YAML that the orchestrator synthesizes into FOE reports.
