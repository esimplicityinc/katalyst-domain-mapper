# PER-005: Framework Adopter

## Overview

The Framework Adopter is an external user who wants to bring the Katalyst Delivery Framework's governance tooling into their own project. They need clear onboarding, customizable templates, and well-documented extension points. They may or may not have existing governance practices to migrate from.

## Key Workflows

1. **Framework Import** -- Copies or installs the delivery-framework package into their project.
2. **Configuration** -- Updates Docusaurus config, sidebars, and branding for their project.
3. **Template Customization** -- Adapts ROAD, ADR, NFR, and change templates to their domain.
4. **Domain Content Creation** -- Creates their own bounded contexts, aggregates, personas, and capabilities.
5. **CI Integration** -- Adds `foe-field-guide validate:governance` and `build:governance` to their CI pipeline.

## Interaction Pattern

Starts with documentation and templates, then moves to CLI tooling. Needs clear getting-started guides and example content that demonstrates patterns without coupling to the FOE domain.
