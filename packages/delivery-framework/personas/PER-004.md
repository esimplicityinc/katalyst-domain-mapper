# PER-004: Documentation Author

## Overview

The Documentation Author is responsible for keeping the project's knowledge artifacts current and well-structured. They write Field Guide methods and observations, maintain DDD domain model documentation, and create ADRs. They rely on validation tooling to catch errors in their frontmatter and cross-references.

## Key Workflows

1. **Field Guide Authoring** -- Writes method and observation markdown files with frontmatter for the FOE Field Guide.
2. **DDD Documentation** -- Creates and updates bounded context, aggregate, value object, and domain event markdown files.
3. **ADR Creation** -- Documents architectural decisions with proper status tracking and supersession chains.
4. **Docusaurus Site Maintenance** -- Ensures sidebar navigation, cross-links, and generated indices reflect current content.
5. **Validation** -- Runs `foe-field-guide validate:governance` to catch frontmatter errors before committing.

## Interaction Pattern

Works primarily in the markdown editor and Docusaurus dev server preview. Uses CLI validation commands to check work. Reviews governance coverage reports to identify documentation gaps.
