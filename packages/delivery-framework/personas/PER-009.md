description: "External services (GitHub, Jira, Confluence) that exchange data with the Katalyst system — providing metrics, syncing governance artifacts, and enabling bidirectional documentation flow."
goals:
  - "Provide CI/CD metrics and deployment frequency data (GitHub Actions)"
  - "Sync governance artifacts bidirectionally with project management tools (Jira)"
  - "Exchange documentation content with knowledge management platforms (Confluence)"
  - "Enable webhook-driven notifications for real-time data flow"
pain_points:
  - "API rate limits constrain polling frequency and batch operations"
  - "Authentication complexity varies across providers (OAuth, API tokens, app installations)"
  - "Data format translation required between external schemas and FOE schemas"
  - "Eventual consistency challenges when syncing bidirectionally"
  - "Provider API changes can break integrations without notice"
behaviors:
  - "Responds to API polling requests from the Katalyst backend"
  - "Provides webhook events for real-time change notifications"
  - "Accepts governance artifact pushes (Jira issue creation, Confluence page updates)"
  - "Serves metrics data (GitHub Actions runs, deployment events, code quality signals)"

# PER-009: External Integration

## Overview

The External Integration persona represents the consolidated set of external services that exchange data with the Katalyst system. Rather than defining separate personas for each provider, this persona captures the common interaction patterns shared by GitHub, Jira, and Confluence integrations.

This persona fills the `external_api` type defined in the persona schema but previously unused.

## Represented Services

### GitHub (CAP-007)
- **Provides:** Actions workflow metrics, deployment frequency, code quality signals (branch protection, PR reviews), repository metadata
- **Accepts:** Governance artifact publication, status checks
- **Stories:** US-020, US-021, US-022, US-023, US-024, US-025

### Jira (CAP-005)
- **Provides:** Project management metrics, issue tracking data, sprint velocity
- **Accepts:** Governance artifact sync (ROAD items as Jira issues), status updates
- **Stories:** US-016, US-017

### Confluence (CAP-006)
- **Provides:** Documentation content, knowledge base articles
- **Accepts:** Governance documentation sync, generated reports
- **Stories:** US-018, US-019

## Key Workflows

1. **Metrics Ingestion** -- Katalyst polls external APIs on schedule to collect metrics (GitHub Actions run durations, deployment events, Jira velocity). Data is transformed into FOE-compatible formats and stored for scan enrichment.
2. **Artifact Sync (Outbound)** -- Governance artifacts (ROAD items, governance snapshots) are pushed to external systems. ROAD items become Jira issues; documentation becomes Confluence pages.
3. **Content Sync (Inbound)** -- External documentation and metrics are pulled into Katalyst to enrich FOE scans. Confluence pages contribute to Understanding scores; GitHub Actions metrics contribute to Feedback scores.
4. **Webhook Reception** -- External services send webhook events for real-time updates (e.g., deployment completed, issue status changed). Katalyst processes these to update cached metrics.
5. **Authentication Management** -- Each provider requires specific authentication (GitHub App installation, Jira API token, Confluence OAuth). PER-002 (Platform Engineer) configures connections; this persona represents the authenticated API surface.

## Interaction Pattern

Passive responder to API requests from the Katalyst backend. Does not initiate contact. All interactions are mediated through the API layer (foe-api) which handles authentication, rate limiting, retry logic, and data transformation. Configured by PER-002 (Platform Engineer) through the API configuration endpoints (US-032).

## Consolidation Rationale

GitHub, Jira, and Confluence share common integration patterns: API polling, webhook events, bidirectional sync, rate limiting, and authentication. Defining a single persona avoids duplicating these shared concerns while still allowing per-provider capability tracking through CAP-005, CAP-006, and CAP-007.
