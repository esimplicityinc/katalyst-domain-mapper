# PER-002: Platform Engineer

## Overview

The Platform Engineer is the primary builder of the Katalyst Delivery Framework infrastructure. They develop the Zod schemas, parsers, CLI commands, API endpoints, and Docker containers that make up the governance pipeline. They are the hands-on implementor who turns the architectural plans into working code.

## Key Workflows

1. **Schema Development** -- Creates and tests Zod schemas for governance and DDD artifact types in `@foe/schemas`.
2. **Parser & Builder Development** -- Implements frontmatter parsers and the governance index builder in `@foe/field-guide-tools`.
3. **CLI Extension** -- Adds new commands (`build:governance`, `validate:governance`, etc.) to the field guide tools CLI.
4. **API Development** -- Creates hexagonal architecture ports, adapters, and use cases for the governance domain in `@foe/api`.
5. **Docker Maintenance** -- Updates the scanner Dockerfile to bake in governance indices alongside methods and observations.

## Interaction Pattern

Works primarily through the CLI and code editor. Runs `bun test`, `bun run build`, and CLI commands to validate their work. Consults the governance index JSON output to verify correctness.
