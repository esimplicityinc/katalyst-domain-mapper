# PER-001: Engineering Team Lead

## Overview

The Engineering Team Lead is the primary consumer of FOE scan reports and governance health data. They use the system to assess their team's engineering maturity, track progress against governance goals, and make data-driven decisions about where to invest in practice improvements.

## Key Workflows

1. **Review FOE Scan Report** -- After a repository scan completes, reviews the cognitive triangle diagram, dimension scores, top strengths, and top gaps.
2. **Monitor Governance Dashboard** -- Checks road item Kanban board, reviews which items are blocked at governance gates, identifies bottlenecks.
3. **Assess Capability Coverage** -- Uses the capability coverage matrix to see which capabilities have adequate test coverage and which need attention.
4. **Track Progress** -- Compares governance snapshots over time to measure improvement trends.

## Interaction Pattern

Primarily interacts through the web UI (foe-web-ui and web-report templates). Consumes data produced by the scanning pipeline and governance index builder. Does not typically create governance artifacts directly -- delegates that to Platform Engineers and AI Agents.
