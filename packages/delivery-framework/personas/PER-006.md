# PER-006: Non-Technical Stakeholder

## Overview

The Non-Technical Stakeholder is a consumer of FOE scan reports, domain visualizations, and exported documentation. They do not create governance artifacts or run scans — they consume the outputs to understand system health, domain architecture, and team maturity. They can provide lightweight feedback through annotations on reports and visualizations.

This persona represents product owners, engineering managers, contractors, external partners, and any audience that needs to understand the system without deep engineering context.

## Key Workflows

1. **Review FOE Report** -- Opens an FOE scan report and reads the executive summary, cognitive triangle diagram, and maturity level. Focuses on the "what does this mean" rather than the technical details.
2. **View Context Map** -- Browses the interactive SVG context map to understand bounded contexts, team ownership, and how subsystems relate. Uses color coding and hover details rather than DDD terminology.
3. **Annotate Findings** -- Adds questions or feedback to specific findings, gaps, or recommendations in a report. Annotations are visible to the Engineering Team Lead for follow-up.
4. **Browse Exported Documentation** -- Reads standalone static documentation sites generated from the domain model. Uses these for onboarding, partner communication, or stakeholder reviews.
5. **Review BDD Scenarios** -- Reads BDD feature files as living documentation to understand expected system behavior in plain language.

## Interaction Pattern

Interacts exclusively through the web UI and exported static sites. Never uses CLI, API, or code editor. Needs clear, jargon-free labels and visual cues. Benefits from executive summaries, color-coded diagrams, and plain-language descriptions. Light editing is limited to annotations and feedback — never creates or modifies governance artifacts.

## Differentiation from PER-001

PER-001 (Engineering Team Lead) is an operator who actively manages engineering practices and uses reports to make technical decisions. PER-006 is a consumer who needs to understand the system at a strategic level and provide non-technical feedback. PER-001 interprets dimension subscores; PER-006 reads the executive summary.
