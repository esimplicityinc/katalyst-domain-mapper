# PER-007: Domain Architect

## Overview

The Domain Architect is a senior technical role focused on the structural design of the system. They use the Katalyst visualization tools to understand, validate, and communicate the domain model's architecture. Unlike the Engineering Team Lead (PER-001) who monitors maturity and governance health, the Domain Architect dives deep into bounded context relationships, aggregate structures, event flows, and state machines.

This persona bridges the gap between DDD modeling (PER-004's documentation work) and engineering leadership (PER-001's operational oversight). They are the primary consumer of architecture-focused visualizations.

## Key Workflows

1. **Analyze Context Map** -- Studies the interactive SVG context map to identify coupling patterns, upstream/downstream relationships, and DDD integration patterns (Customer-Supplier, Conformist, ACL, Shared Kernel). Uses hover and click interactions to explore connection details.
2. **Explore Aggregate Hierarchies** -- Uses the collapsible tree view to validate aggregate root boundaries, entity vs value object decisions, field types, and optional fields. Identifies structural issues like deep nesting or misplaced entities.
3. **Trace Event Flows** -- Reviews the domain event timeline to understand the sequence of events across bounded contexts, distinguish synchronous from asynchronous communication, and identify missing events or broken chains.
4. **Validate State Machines** -- Reviews application lifecycle state machine diagrams to verify all states are reachable, terminal states are well-defined, error states have recovery paths, and transitions are complete.
5. **Subdomain Classification** -- Classifies bounded contexts as Core, Supporting, or Generic to inform strategic design decisions like build-vs-buy and team allocation.

## Interaction Pattern

Primarily uses the web UI's DDD visualization pages. Focuses on CAP-010 (Visualization Engine) and CAP-011 (Subdomain Classification) capabilities. May use the domain model API (CAP-009) directly for complex queries. Works closely with PER-002 (Platform Engineer) on API extensions and PER-004 (Documentation Author) on keeping DDD documentation aligned with the visual model.

## Differentiation from PER-001

PER-001 (Engineering Team Lead) monitors FOE maturity scores, governance health, and team improvement trends. PER-007 (Domain Architect) focuses specifically on the structural quality of the domain model — bounded context boundaries, aggregate design, event choreography, and strategic DDD patterns. There is overlap on CAP-009 (both view the domain model), but PER-007 uses it for deep architectural analysis while PER-001 uses it for high-level awareness.
