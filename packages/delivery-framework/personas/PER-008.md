description: "Automated infrastructure that runs governance validation on commits, executes FOE scans on schedule or PR events, produces machine-readable reports, and enforces quality gates."
goals:
  - "Run governance validation on every commit and pull request"
  - "Execute FOE scans on schedule or triggered by repository events"
  - "Produce machine-readable JSON reports as build artifacts"
  - "Enforce quality gates based on governance maturity thresholds"
pain_points:
  - "No standardized exit codes for governance validation failures"
  - "Scan results require post-processing to integrate with CI dashboards"
  - "Health check endpoints must be polled before scan jobs can be dispatched"
  - "Long-running scans risk CI timeout without progress feedback"
behaviors:
  - "Runs foe-field-guide validate:governance as a pre-commit or CI step"
  - "Executes Docker scanner container on repository checkout"
  - "Collects JSON report output as a build artifact"
  - "Checks API health endpoints before dispatching scan jobs"
  - "Fails the build if governance validation returns non-zero exit code"
  - "Publishes scan results to artifact storage or notification channels"

# PER-008: CI/CD Pipeline

## Overview

The CI/CD Pipeline is a system persona representing the automated infrastructure (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or similar) that integrates Katalyst governance validation and FOE scanning into the development workflow. Unlike PER-003 (AI Agent) which creates and advances governance artifacts, the CI/CD Pipeline is a passive executor that runs validation commands and collects results.

This persona fills the `system` type defined in the persona schema but previously unused.

## Key Workflows

1. **Governance Validation Gate** -- Runs `foe-field-guide validate:governance` as part of a CI pipeline step. If validation fails (non-zero exit code), the pipeline fails and blocks the merge.
2. **Scheduled FOE Scan** -- Runs the Docker scanner container on a schedule (e.g., nightly or weekly). Mounts the repository, passes the API key, and captures the JSON report as a build artifact.
3. **PR-Triggered Scan** -- On pull request events, runs a lighter scan to assess the impact of changes on governance maturity. Posts a summary comment on the PR.
4. **Health Check** -- Polls the API health endpoint (`GET /api/v1/config/health`) before dispatching scan jobs to ensure the backend is available.
5. **Artifact Collection** -- Stores scan reports as CI artifacts for historical tracking and comparison (feeds into US-030 report comparison).

## Interaction Pattern

Executes CLI commands and Docker containers in headless environments. Consumes stdout/stderr and exit codes. Has no interactive capabilities — all behavior is defined by pipeline configuration files (`.github/workflows/*.yml`, `.gitlab-ci.yml`, etc.). Configured and maintained by PER-002 (Platform Engineer).

## Differentiation from PER-003

PER-003 (AI Agent) is an intelligent bot that creates artifacts, makes decisions, and advances governance state. PER-008 (CI/CD Pipeline) is a deterministic executor that runs predefined commands and reports pass/fail. PER-003 runs inside the scanner container; PER-008 orchestrates the container execution.
