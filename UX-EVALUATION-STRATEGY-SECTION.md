### 3. FOE Scanner (`/strategy/foe-scanner`)

**Screenshot:** `foe-scanner-page.png`

**First Impressions:**
- ✅ **Simple, focused interface** with clear purpose
- ✅ **Three action tabs**: Upload File, Scan Directory, Load from API
- ✅ **Large drop zone** with dashed border and centered icon
- ✅ **Clear instructions**: "Drop your FOE report here or click to browse files"
- ✅ **File type guidance**: "Accepts JSON files generated by the FOE scanner"

**Usability:**
- ✅ **Low friction**: Drag-and-drop + click-to-browse both supported
- ✅ **Progressive disclosure**: Only shows upload UI initially (scan/API options available via tabs)
- ✅ **Familiar pattern**: Mimics common file upload UIs (Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.)

**User Journey:**
1. Click "FOE Scanner" from Strategy page or sidebar
2. Arrive at upload interface
3. Choose method (Upload File is default)
4. Drag/drop or browse for JSON file
5. Report visualization appears (not shown in empty state)

**Comparison to FOE Projects:**
- Both have upload functionality
- FOE Scanner is **single-report viewer** (one-off analysis)
- FOE Projects is **multi-project browser** (persistent tracking)
- **Differentiation is clear** from card descriptions on Strategy page

---

### 4. Governance Dashboard (`/strategy/governance`)

**Screenshot:** `governance-dashboard-page.png`

**First Impressions:**
- ✅ **Clean empty state** with shield icon
- ✅ **Clear messaging**: "No Governance Data"
- ✅ **Instructional**: "Ingest a governance snapshot to see health metrics, road item progress, and capability coverage"
- ✅ **Actionable guidance**: "Run the governance sync command to get started"

**Technical Observation:**
- ⚠️ **Console errors present**: `Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found) @ http://localhost:3002/api/v1/governance/latest`
- **Impact**: Non-critical (page renders correctly), but indicates API endpoint might not be implemented yet
- **Recommendation**: Either implement the endpoint or handle the 404 gracefully (suppress console errors in production)

**User Journey:**
1. Click "Governance Dashboard" from Strategy page or sidebar
2. Arrive at empty state
3. Read instructions to run governance sync command
4. (Expected) Run CLI command externally
5. (Expected) Return to dashboard to view ingested data

**Improvement Suggestions:**
- 💡 Provide the **exact CLI command** in the empty state (e.g., `katalyst governance sync`)
- 💡 Add a "Copy Command" button for easy execution
- 💡 Link to documentation on governance data structure
- 💡 Suppress or handle 404 errors gracefully (show a message if API is not configured)
